           Thanks Governor-



           I have been saying that we support the concept of an energy rebate and are waiting to see
           what will be in the final version of the bill.

           So Bill's bill would result in a surplus check being sent to every Alaskan? Not just those
           in utilities? How can I help push it? I'll push that one if Wagoner's bill is dead- which
           it sounds like it is.



           Sharon- I'm cc-ing you be I've been asked by reporters about my intentions on Surplus
           Rebate measures - but I have not known status of such latley. I'll see what else I can
           find out today on these so we have a good, definitive answer for press, for Alaskans. Our
           response so far has been right on- whatever we can do to give the resource owners their
           revenue, thanks to this surplus, we support. But I need to articulate a stronger position
           on it and take more aggressive action before session ends. Sounds like Bill's bill is the
           closest we'll come to that this session. Again, if we don't return the funds to Alaskans,
           govt will spend it and that's not something I support.

           HB 396 is Bill Thomas ' measure .         It has been heard twice and is still

           being worked on in the House Finance Committee .              It sounds as if they

           amended the bill in the last hearing to change the payment from an

           additional $ 500 permanent fund earning distribution to a general fund

           surplus payment.



           Wagoner and Therriault have a different version in the Senate Finance

           Committee .     Their bill would make energy payments to the utilities as an

           energy credit that would be reflected on individual ' s invoices.

           Wagoner's bill has not received a hearing to date.



           Mike

           Where is HB396 ? If they don ' t allow one of the many forms of

           energy/ surplus dividends this session ,          I'm afraid it will be too easy

           for them to cont to hold on to the surplus             ( and ultimately spend it),

           instead of giving back to Alaskans - the resource owners. Which

           legislator ( s)    controls these measures that could succeed in giving more

           of the surplus to residents instead of govt?

           The House and Senate are both going into sessio at 2 PM .             I think much

           is happening this morning .         They usually leave enough time for folks to

           go to morning church.



           I have heard that the Legislature may get done one day early              ( Sat).   I

           do not see how the Senate can leave on friday at this point .              They need

           to concur on the capital budget otherwise they are accepting that all

           our projects including the roads , oil and gas , etc. are not needed. If

           the House put the final capital budget on the floor wed/thurs ,             sat seems

           possible.



           I plan on trying to get a total spending spreadsheet from Meyer today.

           It will help our discussions with the House.

           Hi guys : do you know what time Hse or Senate meets today ? Wondering if I

           should get things done around here before heading over to the office.



          Nice editorial in the ADN today, pointing out the posturing of leggies

           re: Sp Session and their request for expanded call.

                                                                3

           Talked to a reporter on Friday's return flt to Juneau - he said he's

           hearing Senate intends to gavel out on Friday, with or without       House's

           completion of work. Does that mean the House finishes up when they need

           to, and it' s an assumed concurrence by the Senate on the final product

           then?
