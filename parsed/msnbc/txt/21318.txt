               §         I can't believe Pedro is before us. He was inconsistent between his private
              memos and his public testimony. I take his testimony with a grain of salt.

                   §       Recommend no changes to PPT. Except transparency provisions.



                           In original PPT, review provision in 2011. Wait until then.



                §         Goal of PPT : lower government take on more expensive fields ,       incentivizing them
               to increase production.



               §         The current system is designed to be sensitive to costs and to be price
              progressive.



               §         PPT credits encourage investments by new investors in new oil and gas
              exploration and development and to encourage re-investment by existing companies.



                §          The main goal is to reduce the decline of production.



               §         My previous personal opinion was well documented in writing, and it differed
              from Governor Murkowski' s goal . I have been perfectly consistent.



                §          My previous recommendations should be implemented:




               o          25/20




               o        Eliminate clawback provision that rewards a company for past investments.
              (Delete the transitional investment expenditures credit.)



               o        I recommended a combination gross and net: a price progressive feature based on
              gross in addition to the 25% PPT rate.



               o        Gross Revenue Exclusion for pipeline gas of 641 of the - gross value of the prior
              to the application of the PPT for gas other than from cook inlet . Gas that needs to be
              transported over long distances has very different economics than oil.



               o         I previously warned you of strong price escalations.



               o         Audit before you conclude that there have been significant price increases.

                 o        The 10% floor is a political sham. I strongly recommend against this. It turns
                the PPT into a tax that is essentially ring-fenced for the large fields. It also removes
                the benefits of promoting reinvestment by the large companies.
