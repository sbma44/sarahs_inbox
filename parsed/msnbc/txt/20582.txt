          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,




          I enjoyed meeting you, brief as it was at the Palmer fair. You mentioned that you were
          coming down to the Kenai Peninsula this weekend, and I would love give you a tour of the
          fair grounds here in Ninilchik and talk about ways we can help encourage our peninsula
          youth to continue raising Alaska Grown livestock and vegetables. This year 49 youth
          participated in the JML livestock auction, with total sales of over $70,000. That is
          amazing.  I live at the fair grounds so can be available any time. Please feel free to
          call me on my cell phone (907) 398-4468.




          I hope to see you.




                                                                1
