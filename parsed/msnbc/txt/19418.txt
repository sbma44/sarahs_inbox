              It's a personnel matter, though Tara, so despite what he may say to the public... it's a personnel
              matter and no need to comment. I'll ask Mike to chime in if further comment for you to relay is
              necessary. Thanks!

              I wish he'd taken the offer to better serve the state by better utilizing his talents and connections
              with rural Alaska by accepting the ABC Board Ex Dir position- that way he'd be able to
              concentrate on bootlegging and the horrendous problems caused by alcohol in our rural
              communities. He's chosen not to accept that role in state service, but instead to exit state service
              entirely.

              I read what is on the ADL webpage . I think Sharon's response so far is good . I expect to .get calls come
              Monday from the rural caucus and stakeholders in Rural Alaska and probably big native corps like AFN,
              CIRI, all the BB's, Pribilofs , Interior and Northwest.

              My stance is that it is not unusual for an Administration to change people out as the Governor sees
              appropriate to meet her goals for Alaska . Let me know if I need to say something different tj
