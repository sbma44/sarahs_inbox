                 Subject: ENERGY SUMMIT MEETING - LEENs " Life Essential Energy Needs " for our homes
                 Date: 4-21-08
                 TO: Chow .. Dillingham city manager
                 FROM: Paul D. Kendall - energy consultant and activist

                REF:: General PUblic Energy Summit and Forum Discussion-Direction, Vision-- action
                  need 5 days long, 12 hours per day, and live on camera,,, panel up and panel down,,,data set,
                data set, data sets,,, need to gather all the information we can...need to hear from all sectors ---
                discontented, disconnected, distempered,,,, ha ha,,,, lets hear it all --- focus on residential needs.
                feeedstock owners, generation suppliers, area awarenesses, etc...
                LET US FORM OUR OWN GRID! A "PEOPLES STATEWIDE ENERGY GRID OF
                COMMUNICATIONS" WITH EACH OTHER IN REGARDS TO OUR HOMES...AND
                FAMILIES NEEDS ( responsible, fair and realistic needs) Each of you has to realize you as
                isolated and remote areas are expendable and collateral sacrafices! Once you face this we can
                begin to achieve something....
                lets see who is up to what across the state especially in information being compiled....
                in uses times , amounts, frequencies, for, from etc... new ideas, time frames, leaders in the know,,,
                energy languages,,,
                updates on what oil companies are doing....
                etc... lets all get together and shake hands on something that helps us all
                like a state wide electric grid or intertie line,,, lets build us an electricial hydroelectric backbone
                network,,, owned by the people ans managed by private companies or something..
                How can we all communicate at one time? Do we need a communications center or director fo
                energy issues only for meetings, films, product costs and demostrations and chat rooms for
                energy uses only
                If we stableize our homes first will that bring more opportunity to enterprise sectors...??

                I can get the Marston Therater for May 8 thur ,9 fri, from 7 am to 5pm and May 10, sat 7 to
                noon
               at 65$ per hour and a camera crew for around 1,000.oo to film live.....
               and maybe some native corporation, city, company or organization would sponsor ..Juneau has a
               lot of money and i hear they are upset about paying 50 cents per kwh instead of 6 cents ( too
               bad they werent making hydrogne gas in the night time and storing it to run generators in an
               emergency mooment like now....... Look, we could do this for around 25 hours X $ 65 + camera
               crew for $1,000 which woudl equal $3,000 = maybe some pizza and pepsi... dont spend money
               on newspaper, instead call radio talk shows and departments to come and learn us up....
               and Do a live call in like American Idol.....Alaska Energy Statewide Speakerphone Call in where
               the people call in to register and comment and they pay for call..
               by puting this on camera we could all learn from each other at one timie across the state....

               Anyway, chow,,,, something to think about !
               Maybe you coud circualte my attached 5 pages and this e-mail to other communites like a tree
               fax thing and departments and we coudl all pitch in to pay for this energy summit our selves .... i
               am not a wealthy man, but i could work hard for little or nothing... an chip in $20.oo..-- I could

                 go to GCI and get a message phone to leave messages on for i think aaround 12.00 for amonth... and see
                 if the marston has a phone line where people could call in and we could put them on a speaker
                 It might be fun'to see how well all the little or average people and communities could get together and
                 do something like this..... who cares if it is not real pretty......ya know....
                 mke us some signs for each community when talking and send us an anal picture of your community to
                 put on camera for others to see
                 ---maybe put together a report on how much electricity each home uses and where you get it and how
                 much you pay along with who owns the eneergy you use in your community so we can get a picture
                 here.....

                 Well, looks like i got carried away.... Paul D. Kendall
                 907-222-7882
                 ps.. Should Juneau spend some of their money to come here and host this event to ask us for some
                 more of our money and show us their pain...?? @ 50 cents per KWH projected for them to pay becaue of
                 the avalanche ---- not to minimise the villages staggering fuel prices!?

                 I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE US ALL SHARE IDEAS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS TO
                 GENERATE ELECTRICITY! SEE WHAT ALL OF US CAN COME UP WITH ? PERHAPS WE
                 CAN CONTACT A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND OFFER THEM A LARGE CONTRACT TO
                 PURCHASE IF THEY CAN COME UP HERE AND CHECK IT OUT AT THEIR EXPENSE....????
                 i NOTICED ON THE MAP THAT MOST ALL VILLAGES AND COMMUNTIES ARE LOCATED
                 ON OR NEAR RIVERS AND COASTLINES......
                 WHAT ARE OUR COUNTERWEIGHTS CAPABILITIES ... REMEMBER LIKE THE OLD COO
                 KOO CLOCKS.... ETC...
