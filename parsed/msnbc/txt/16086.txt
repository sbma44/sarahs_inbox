           Lyda voted for AGIA.

           She's dropping out due to all the recent polls showing how far behind Linda she is.

           You can tell Ross that, in ypur own special way. My phone won't allow me coverage through
           Nenana. :)

           Governor-




            Channel 2 just called to say that lyda just issued a press release saying she will not
           seek reelection.  She says it is because of the AGIA process. She says it has the support
           of many of her constituents but she thinks it is a disasterous move for the state. Mike
