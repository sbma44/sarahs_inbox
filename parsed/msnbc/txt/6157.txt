             Dear Mr. Swank - I am following up with the Commissioner's Office at the Dept. of Commerce, Community &
             Economic Development. I understand your concern and will see what I can learn about the next steps with the
             Board of Architects & Engineers and what may be possible to address the issues you are raising . Karen Rehfeld

            BUDGET COMMENTS:

            I was very pleased to see the governor 's veto of the projects that she did , she could have continued for
            an additional 300Mil in my opinion (total around 500 to 600Mil)

            As a second generation Alaskan (57 years age) and also owning a private engineering firm involved in the
            construction of projects around Alaska and the world, yes this is a economic negative to my business, however
            the larger picture is much more important for Alaska if it is ever to develop like I would like.

            The State does not and never has had a true financially balanced budget and politics have also negatively
            affected this issue for the self gains of a few as well as enormous negative ethics issues.
            I can only hope that this current administration continues down the same path of fiscal responsibility, ethical
            practices and true economic development of the state. I would like nothing better than the reduction of the state
            government while encouraging the expansion of the private sector business areas to include manufacturing etc.
            which is possible within this state. In short a true development of many none governmental businesses as well as
            general cities development and growth. I am involved is such areas in many other cities, states and countries
            around the world and have found these issues extremely troublesome with regards to Alaska and its lack of
            performance in all such areas.

            I love the State but am extremely dissatisfied with its lack of direction involving true economic growth,
            diversification and its continued expansion of State government and political corruption . Both my private and
            business interests have been affected by such issues directly (corruption) and as a result I will be filing several
            law suits against the State of Alaska and some of it 's employees within the next 4 months


            CONTINUING EDUCATION COMMENTS:
            I have previously sent and voiced my opinion with regards to the Continuing education issue involving the Board
            of Architects and engineers licensing.
           I have attached an email sent to the board by another professional state engineer which also addresses many of
           my concerns.
           Please be aware that the board has received hundreds of such complaints but no doubt has not forwarded them
           to your office.

            This state administrative organization and its board have also made statements that they have no interest in the
            views and opinions and desires of the licensed members and are going to proceed forward with such regulations.

            This is astounding to me and thus I now feel that I must add the following additional comments to be forward to
            both the governors office as well as the OMB.


            1. THIS RESPONSE BY A STATE OF ALASKA DEPARTMENT, LEGALLY DEMONSTRATES THE BOARDS
            POSITION AND THE STATES POSITION (THE STATE EMPLOYEES) REGARDLESS OF:

                 THE POSITION OF ALL PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED INDIVIDUALS (I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE
                   PROCESS)
                 DOES THE BOARD NOT REPRESENT THE LICENSED INDIVIDUALS?
                 THE STATE OF ALASKA LEGAL STATUES
                 THE STATE OF ALASKA CONSTITUTION
                 THE "ENTIRE MANDATE OF THE BOARD" AND NOT 'SELECTIVE TWISTING AND MISUSE OF THE MANDATE BY ? "
            2. THE QUESTION IS ALSO NOW STARTING TO BE RAISED

                 DO WE HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITHIN THE BOARD ?
                 DO WE HAVE DIRECT OF INDIRECT FINANCIAL GAINS TO EITHER BOARD MEMBERS OR STATE OF ALASKA STAFF, EMPLOYEES
                  OR PUBLIC REPRESENTATION?
                 I WILL AGAIN NOTE THAT REQUESTING INDIVIDUALS HAVE NEVER BEEN FURNISH WITH "WHO OR WHICH PARTIES" ARE
                    PUSHING THIS. WHICH PUBLIC REPRESENTATION, STATE DEPARTMENT, ETC. WHO ARE THE LOBBYIST INVOLVED? WHO IS
                  PAYING THE LOBBYISTS?
            3. WHAT HISTORICAL JUSTIFICATION EXISTS FOR THIS POLICY OR ACTION BY THE BOARD?

                 HOW MANY YEARS OF RECORDS AND ACTUAL COMPLAINTS (BOARD MAINTAINS) EXISTS WITH REGARDS TO PUBLIC
                  COMPLAINTS AGAINST ENGINEERS INVOLVING SUCH ISSUES?
                 THESE RECORDS WILL SHOW AND PROVE THAT THE COMPLAINTS OR ISSUE'S INVOLVED WOULD "NOT" HAVE BEEN
                  PREVENTED BY CONTINUING EDUCATION?
                 AGAIN ACTUAL COMPLAINTS AND RECORDS WILL SHOW "OTHERWISE" THUS NO BASIS EXISTS.
                 NOW "PRECONCEIVED THOUGHT PATTERNS BY INDIVIDUALS WILL SAY YES IT WILL (EDUCATION IS ALWAYS A POSITIVE).
                 THIS IS WHAT THE PARTIES PUSHING THIS ARE HOPING FOR AND THAT THE STATE AND BOARD WILL NOT PERFORM A
                  RESPONSIBLE PROPER REVIEW OF ALL ISSUES INVOLVED.
                 FACTS ARE THE OPPOSITE . NOTHING WILL CHANGE (SAME PUBLIC COMPLAINTS BASIS WILL BE CONTINUED TO BE FILLED)
                   AND THUS UNCHANGED.
                 THUS THE PUBLIC "WILL NOT BE PROTECTED AS NOW BEING USED AS PART OF THE BASIS AND LOGIC"
                 OH BUT HOW $$$$ WILL BE MADE BY SOME INDIVIDUALS AND OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS AND
                  PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES.

            4. AGAIN I AND MOST INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT AGAINST "VOLUNTARY" CE COMPLIANCE AND THUS
            MAINTAINING OUR INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS AND RIGHTS. THAT IS HAVING THE PROFESSIONAL
            SOCIETIES PERFORM SUCH AND NOT THE STATE OF ALASKA. THIS IS AGAIN WHAT IS DONE FOR
            ACCOUNTANTS, ATTORNEYS AND DOCTORS. ENGINEERS ARE WITHIN THIS SAME GROUP OF
            "PROFESSIONALS".

            IT IS MY OPINION THAT THESE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES HAVE STARTED A NATIONWIDE EFFORT OF
            LOBBING FOR SUCH AT THE STATE LEVEL TO AGAIN GET THEM $$$$$ THIS BEING THE EASIEST WAY
            TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOAL OF SELF ECONOMIC GAIN WITHOUT TRYING TO PERFORM THIS
            THEMSELVES WITH THEIR MEMBERS. THIS ALSO MAKES THEM LOOK BETTER AND THUS TRYING TO
            PORTRAY THAT THEY ARE NOT THE CULPRIT BUT RATHER THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THEIR MAY
            ALSO BE SOME LOCAL LOBBING AND MANIPULATION BY OTHER GROUPS AS WELL FOR SELF GAINS
            OR ADVANTAGES.


           5 THIS APPEARS DEFINITELY HEADED TO A COURT CHALLENGE AND CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE
           STATE OF ALASKA , PARTIES INVOLVED AND ALSO THE OPTION OF FILLING AN INJUNCTION AS

             WELL.

                . STATE PARTIES INVOLVED HAVE NOT ADEQUATELY GATHERED THE APPROPRIATE DATA AND
                  PREFORMED ALL ISSUES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS REQUIRED BY PRIOR OFFICIALS OF THE
                  STATE, STATE LEGAL STATUES AND THE STATE OF ALASKA CONSTITUTION.
