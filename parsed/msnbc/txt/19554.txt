           The Governor will not be in Fairbanks at 1:00 p.m. I think if we sent a letter and flag
           certificate that will be fine. Thanks, Janice

            the Governor wants to attend??? Janice do you want to respond to her??? We are already
            sent a letter and flag with cert.
