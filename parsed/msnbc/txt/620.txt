  Sensitivity : Confidential

  I am pleased to report to you the 2004 VPP results for Alaska. The attached note "2004 Business
  Update" and slide-pack provide the details behind our final VPP score as well as a took forward to
  2005. The E&P Segment had an excellent year and Alaska played a large part in that success.

    -E&P segment rating: 140 points - a very good outcome
    -Range of SPU scores in E&P: 125 to 145
    -Alaska SPU score: 135
    (base performance contract delivery = 100 points, stretch delivery = 150 points)

 2004 VPP is solely based on Alaska SPU or Functional Group performance as applicable. The Alaska
 SPU score of 135 points was awarded based on strong E&P Segment results, delivery of Alaska
 strategy, strong cash flow and best ever safety performance. Congratulations! Payment will be-via a
 separate check paid in the March 25th timeframe.

 Variable Pay Program - 2005
 It is also a good time to let you know that the 2005 Variable Pay Program for employees in Level E
 and below remains unchanged from 2004. As a reminder, the key features of our program are:


     . 2/3 of the bonus will reward team performance on an equal basis for all employees.
     . 1/3 of the bonus will be differentiated based on individual performance (except for
        our hourly staff in Alaska).
     . Bonus target/maximums are differentiated at each Level based on market competitiveness.



                                                                                              ROSTON 00775

  The bonus pool will again be based entirely on our SPU (of Function) performance against our annual plan
  using the 'balanced scorecard' approach. As in 2004, the scoring mechanism will be based on target and
  stretch performance whereby 150 points are assigned to full stretch delivery of hte annual plan and 100
  points are assigned to base delivery (target bonus opportunity).

 Thank you for your achievements and dedication to safety in 2004. Here's to having another successful
 year in 2005.

Quarterly Alaska Business Update - 4Q04                                                                        February 2005
Following the recent release of BP's 2004 results, I would like to provide you with an overview of our 2004 Alaska
performance and provide additional context surrounding our strategy.
First and foremost, thank you. All things considered, 2004 was a good year - most notably in safety performance.
2004 was our safest year on record in Alaska and for the entire E&P Segment! The Alaska business was a key
contributor to BP's success. The robust price environment underpinned a successful year in which BP worldwide
enjoyed record earnings. We materially advanced the Alaska strategy; we put our first "Alaska C/ass" tanker into
service, we made significant progress towards gas commercialization, and we established a "buzz" around viscous oil.
We remain on course to deliver the Alaska Strategy. 2005 will be another important year. There are many challenges
ahead, but I am confident that with focus and teamwork we can continue our excellent track record of delivery and
make progress towards creating and maintaining a competitive and sustainable business in Alaska for many decades
to come.



H S E- Extraordinary Delivery in 2004!
Safety. 2004 stands out as our safest year ever in Alaska! Compared to 2003 we had 22 fewer recordables and 6
fewer DAFWC, meeting our targets in DAFWCF and RIF. Last years excellent results were achieved through your
personal commitment to safety and your quality safety inputs. 2004 was also the safest year in E&P's history and we
are now close to being the best in the industry. We are now in a position to build on our success; in 2005 our targets
again reflect a desire for continuous safety improvement.
Environment Spill performance still needs improvement. Although we had fewer spills in 2004 than the previous
year, the volume was higher. Your continued commitment to our EMS and focus on spill prevention is essential.

RWO's and sidetracks at Endicott . Delivery of water projects and injection management made significant progress in
2004 and that theme will continue in 2005.
 Viscous Oil, Unlocking the viscous prize is a key plank of our strategy , with substantial pull for more viscous
production . The GPB Orion team continued their drilling success in 2004 by completing the first ever quadralateral
and spudding the first pentalateral that was recently completed this year . Last year a multidiscipline Viscous Oil
Production Assurance Team (VPAT) was established to develop a GC-2 viscous facility strategy which helped deliver
peak production of 15mbd gross from Orion . In GKA, our partners drilled nine wells at West Sak 1E (WS1E) last year
and the West Sak 1J (WS1J) project was sanctioned . Five wells will be drilled at WS1E in 2005 . Once complete,
drilling at WS1J will commence where 31 more wells are planned ( 37% BP). We continue to review our viscous oil
strategy with a view to addressing facility bottlenecks & accelerating development . Our current view of waterfloodable
viscous production includes ramping up from 25mbd to 50mbd net over the next 5 years. We 've recently approved
the formation of a dedicated Viscous Technology Team to focus on further viscous growth.
Gas Commercialization : Gas feels more like a reality than ever before . In 2004 we made significant progress
towards gas commercialization . The President signed the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act, and negotiations with the
State are underway . In addition to a durable State fiscal contract , Canada must establish a clear regulatory
framework to enable the project to proceed. Once these components are in place, we believe the $1 billion
engineering and permitting phase could begin.
 Transformation: In 2004 we opened the Operations Support Center ( OSC) and the first of four "Alaska Class"
tankers was put into service . Our second double hull tanker is scheduled for delivery in March 2005 and our third in
4Q 2005. These vessels will enable considerable cost reductions in the midstream . In addition TAPS owners are

four critical pump stations, combined with increased automation and upgraded control systems.


Performance- despite shortfalls in production and cost targets, our tremendous safety performance
combined with delivery of key Strategic milestones and the excellent E&P Segment delivery resulted in
a generous VPP payout. The Alaska VPP score for 2004 is 135.

development. ACT ended the
year 1.1 mboed below Plan.
Longer than forecast plateau production at Northstar helped offset decline at Kuparuk , and challenges elsewhere in
ACT. I am acutely aware that headline production performance masks significant effort and pockets of excellence -
most notably , Northstar was 6 mbd above Plan.
Costs; 2004 Cash Costs were $830m, up $77m compared to 2003 . This difference was largely due to increased
insurance costs in 2004 and the impact of higher oil prices on bunker fuel costs . Lifting costs were $ 17m higher in
2004 compared to 2003 . GPB lifting costs are up $4m due in large part to base O&M increases . The balance of the
lifting cost increase relates to employee benefit costs . CPAI-operated Kuparuk had $ 3m additional wellwork spend in
2004 as higher oil price provided opportunities for additional work.
Capex: 2004 Capex of $672.7m was $20m above FY 2004 Plan. This was primarily due to phasing of spend in the
midstream on new build tankers and the TAPS pipeline.


Year Ahead
People: We have a great opportunity in 2005 to make Alaska a more rewarding place to work - building on our
success over the past several years. While the overall People Assurance Survey results remained relatively flat, we did
see a substantial increase in satisfaction from town-based staff and some good results in the field. We are convinced
that overall employee satisfaction can be increased through distinctive leadership, engagement and communication.
With the PAC Tech strike behind us, we need to re-build our relationships in the field and turn our attention to making
this business a great place to work. Our aim will be to ensure that all aspects of our people agenda are accomplished
with quality.
HSE: We need to sustain our excellent and quality inputs to Safety in 2005. EMS will continue to guide our
improvement in the environmental area; in 2005 a particular focus area will be to improve spill performance. In the
year ahead we will implement a field wide Hazard Recognition Program that was piloted in 2004 and complete
implementation of the group Driving Standard. We also plan to roll out the E&P Segment Energy Isolation Immersion.
Costs: In 2004 our operating costs were largely driven by external factors including higher fuel prices and oil field
price inflation, but we also saw increases in our base O&M costs. The sustainability of our business is determined, to
a large extent, by cost structure. We face similar pressures in 2005 and it is imperative that we maintain focus and
discipline in this area.
Production: We find ourselves in a challenging place to start the year; to date 2005 production is below Plan. The
issue in 2004 was operating efficiency both for light oil and for viscous oil. The issue has carried over into the New
Year. Only by regaining our capacity can we truly benefit from new initiatives like LoSal, viscous development and a
revitalized focus on voidage replacement. Another essential component of our progress this year is to embrace
technologies and processes that accelerate reserves progression. In spite of the challenging start to the year our past
performance shows that this is something that we can overcome.
 Tax. The State of Alaska's recent production tax increase through changes to ELF (Economic Limit Factor) is a serious
issue and one which I want all staff to feel empowered to discuss internally and externally. The bottom line is that
Alaska is the highest cost of supply in BP's portfolio and increased taxes make Alaska a more difficult place to compete
globally for investment. The recent ELF changes are yet another example of the need for a stable and endurino tax
environment to give us the confidence for a Gas project to move forward.
