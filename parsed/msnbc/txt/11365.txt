              His office will help so we 're not accused of ignoring any requests.

             Absolutely. Any time you or your office needs it and we have the ability we'll do.



               (Today and tomorrow I am with Privileg in Seattle but Kris S--my DCOS and Jason Hooley can
             meet.) Also, I have email access most of the day on my BB so I appreciate your cc:s and
             updates.

             Lt. Governor: if at all possible, if we're missing any appts that are being requested by
            local officials, can we tap into your office for assistance? There are only so many hrs in
            the day, we're not refusing anyone an opportunity to meet with me and/or third floor
            officials, but evidently some AML members don't think we're trying hard enough. I am
            canceling more internal mtgs with staff to meet with others, but still... there are only
            so many slots in one day. Thanks

              Janice- has mayor Williams (ketchikan) even asked for a mtg during this week's visit? Has
             Tim Beck?



              Sharon/Beth- if u get the sense this gripe is growing legs (as my gut is telling me), pls
             respond with a stronger, proactive statement re: we DO rearrange scheds to make sure every
             mayor requesting does get a mtg. Thanks

              It's a scorcher. Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I won't/didn't spend
             time w/ the Mayors... sheeeesh...

              Sharon ' s comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our office . That's
             our committment.



              I don't want this issue to grow legs , so whatever we have to do to make sure we're not
             double-booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that they 're being ignored - we'll do
             it.



              Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I have not done
             that and it ' d be refreshing if reporters asked for facts to back up complaints like
             that ... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug local officials into the schedule as best we
             can - even if that means cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches. Thanks
