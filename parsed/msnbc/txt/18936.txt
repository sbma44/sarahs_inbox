          Governor,



          Received now. I was not aware of any need or discussion to hold it in Fairbanks.



          I read the Ear story today suggesting that the announcement was originally scheduled to
          take place in Fairbanks tomorrow. That is news to me. It had been scheduled by Revenue
          for last week.

          Was I not supposed to announce pfd? Pls see my email below that wasn't received due to a
          yahoo glitch:

           Pat and Mike- in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd, I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks, and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event "out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate, and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea, I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past, except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate, hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.



           If this was "hijackiing" it or it was out of line, surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
