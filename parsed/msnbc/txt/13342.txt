             > April 23 , 2008, Anchorage , Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green ' s request
             to expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin
             today outlined her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can
             show a path to success.

             > House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial-birth abortion, and House Bill
             364, relating to parental consent, failed due to inaction by the Senate. The Governor
             expressed disappointment that Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option
             during the regular session to move the legislation.

             > "Alaskans know I am pro-life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of
             every human life ," Governor Palin said . " These issues are so important they shouldn't be
             diluted with oil and gas deliberations."

             > Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently
             than last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the
             full Senate.
