              Governor,
              Kelly can give you further detail on this, but Senator McGuire is unable to attend the bill signing and has strongly
              requested/insisted that we hold off for another date. The bottom line is, we will not have a bill signing at the MOD
              walk.

              The plan the sponsors hope you'll adopt is to be the last speaker before the walk begins, offer brief remarks, and
              then lead the walk with two families (one of which is the Kolendo family from Wasilla) who have received
              assistance from MOD. What I need to know from you is, would you like to only do the walk, or would you be
              willing to offer a few brief remarks, as well?
