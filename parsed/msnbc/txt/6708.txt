        Fyi - this is unprecedented, I believe, that litigation would be pursued re: our fisheries
        nominees . Just fyi for now.

        I am writing to request that your respective principals communicate = their support to the
        Secretary of Commerce for Governor Palin's nominations = to the North Pacific Fisheries
        Management Council.




        The Secretary is receiving pressure from recreational groups = which are insisting that
        one of the Governor' s appointments have a = specific recreational perspective.
        Apparently, they are now = threatening litigation if this does not occur.



        We have previously apprised the Secretary of the rationale for the = Governor's
        nominations.  In addition, we have enlisted the support of = various Alaska fishing
        groups, some of which have already sent letters.&nbs= p;



        I don't think that the Secretary will disapprove either of = the Governor's appointments.
        There is no precedent for this, and one = or more members of the NPFMC have a recreational
        perspective.




        Further, we doubt that litigation would be successful .  However , federal officials
        sometimes become risk averse when litigation = is threatened.

        In these circumstances , strong expressions of support for the = Governor ' s nominees could
        go a long way in averting unnecessary conflict = between the State and the Department of
        Commerce.



        Thanks for considering this request. If we can provide any = further information,                please
        let me know.




        Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
        <mailto:jwkatz@alaskadc.org> jwkatz@alaskadc.org. = Thank you .=
