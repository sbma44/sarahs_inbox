    Subject : Clearly Arctic - Initial Info
   Signs point to Mat Maid as owner of the Clearly Arctic name so far, showing that it started the
   website domain www.clearlyaretic.com. The Creamery Corporation registered the "Clearly
   Arctic" Federal Trademark. (Backup on both are below).

   Todd, you requested info on Terry Clark and so far there is very little. I've checked the
   Corporations, Business License databases, and I'll check worker's comp with DOL and Corporate
   Net Income payments to DOR. Terry Clark (unless he holds an Indiana address and part-owns
   Capitol Construction out of Juneau) doesn't show as a partner or business owner of a current
   business.

   Under Eagle River Roofing, business license # 900313, I don't show Clark' s name on the record, but
   rather Steven Benson (Chugiak, AK), and Tanner Benson (Cooper Landing, AK) on the record.
