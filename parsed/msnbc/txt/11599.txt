               Governor,

               After reviewing the options on where to build the new Crime Lab, Anchorage was chosen over Kenai and The
               Mat-Su Valley for the following reasons:

                    APD is by far the largest user at 72% and even if such usage rate continued , a move to Kenai would drive
                     up their expense in shipping evidence and slow their responsiveness to the citizens they serve.

                    The staff currently working at the Crime Lab would have to uproot themselves and their families and that
                     may cause some to re-think employment with DPS; a consideration as the crime Lab is currently
                     understaffed.

                    Many Troopers transport their prisoners into Anchorage and hand carry evidence to the Crime Lab now, to
                     move the Lab out of Anchorage would further tie up that traveling Trooper to other communities, like
                     Palmer or Kenai, before he or she can return to their assigned post.

                    Finally, the cost for the land in Anchorage is the same price as it would be in Kenai, no cost. (As per
                     conversation with MOA Heritage Land Bank Manager with Deputy Commissioner Glass.)

               Any questions, please contact me anytime.
               -Wait
