          After 7 days we've been unable to reach Privileged or of Privileged for the final spot on
          CACFA.   He must be out of town. Todd provided the name o Native Alaskan Frank Woods this
          morning whom I spoke to. His background: He's on DNR's Snow Track Committee, the Federal
          Subsistence Advisory Council, and the Native American Fish & Wildlife Society. He had
          some DUI issues over 23yrs ago but no issues recently. If he sounds good to you, our
          final panel would be:
