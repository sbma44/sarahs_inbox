               I am concerned about our Governor's Health

               One of the worst chemical exposures for the unborn, is that of 2-
               butoxyethanoi

               When Lorenzo was 5 his family moved from Africa to a big city house near
               Wash DC
               and the leukodystrophy showed up at that time

               It could have been triggered by something as simple as using cleaning
               products there that were strong in this chemical
               www.vaidezllnk.com/pages/cleanconcluding.htm


               Could we err on the side of caution and use less hazardous cleaning products
               in the Governor's Mansion?
