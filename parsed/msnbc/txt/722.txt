Hello Governor,



Yes, I received it and we'll get it taken care of with the least amount of fuss .



When this phase of the plumbing project is over I had requested to have the portable W/D moved to
the 3rd floor linen closet, so it shouldn't be an issue. I apologize for involving Linda in these kinds of
matters. My understanding is that she was not opposed to taking care of this; she wanted to work it
so it wouldn't appear like something out of the norm-i.e. using areas that were closest to existing 220
outlets and running the conduit from there. I think that we're fine if we include it with the w/d on the
3rd floor.



It's good/helpful to know how you want things handled, so I appreciate your feedback!



On a day like today-I wish the bed was ready to go for you to use right away!!



Thanks,

Erika

Thanks Erika.



I misunderstood and didn't realize the bed was already in the cedar closet. Yes, see what it would
take to get the power extension there... it shouldn't take much and should be compared to a situation
such as during this renovation had we had a need for a dryer to be placed upstairs instead of in this
guest bathroom- what would that extension take? I just don't want Linda making a big deal out of
this- and don't want family requests to be made public in any way as they had through Stephanie.
Thanks!
