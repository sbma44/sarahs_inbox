            I like her!

            PS, It's finally sunny in Juneau. I'm going outside.

            I-told -you-so is not the song of a good leader for Alaska
            It's become painfully obvious why Andrew Halcro didn't win the election. Why in the world would
            Alaskans elect a person who takes such glee in the failure of the dairy and any other negative news
            regarding state Issues? Rather than using his voice to propel us all forward with better ideas,
            Halcro is more concerned with being right and screaming "I told you so!" at the top of his lungs.
            I fully support Palin's decision to investigate the state of the dairy and explore all options to keep it
            open if it was economically viable to do so. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise: Too many
            livelihoods are at stake.
            Halcro still hasn't learned that Alaskans are tired of negative, embittered, "My way is the only way"
            divisive-style leadership. Many of us have great ideas, but few of us can lead. Halcro had no desire
            to lead, only to herd and be heard. We might listen if he had anything positive to contribute.
