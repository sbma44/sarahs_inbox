             Governor,

            I just talked to Steve and provided him additional background information . He said that so far, he has been
            unable to reach Lyda . I let him know that I spoke with Lyda and made offers in numerous formats to help provide
            the Legislature information on our proposal , how we came to that decision and why we think it is best for Alaska.
            I also told him that since there was not much interest , I requested the assistance of other members of leadership
            to schedule meetings before and during special session so we could speed up the educational process and help
            have a more successful session . I also offered to a number of other leadership members our willingness to sit
            down and walk them through additional information . Some are individually interested . I let him know that in
            addition to my calls , Russ had been in contact with Lyda. He was very thankful for the information.

             Mike
