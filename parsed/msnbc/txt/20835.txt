          Thanks, Governor.  We are prepared to respond to questions from the media on the work your
          administration is doing relating to Climate Change. I'll keep Mike and Joe informed and
          provide any other assistance I can.



          Best wishes on the campaign trail!



          Larry

          Hi guys! Checkin in. I anticipate folks will be inquiring about our polar bear issue,
          though it hasnt cropped up yet that I've heard of.
    }       Climate change is a top issue of course. Just head's up. Also, predator control's been
          quiet, but let me know if the issue's volume gets turned up and I need to respond to
          anything. Thanks guys! Hang in there... I appreciate you sincerely.
