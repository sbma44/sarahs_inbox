          If he did the deed, he should pay the price. It's a shame the whole party gets tarred when

           I crossed paths with Senator Stevens years ago when I worked for the federal government.
           Though I was Republican I took a strong dislike to him. He was arrogant -- as was Lugar.

          bandsaw thrown at them . My guess is , this old Alaskan crab has about 12 colleagues who
          also deserve indictment . Its time we cleaned out and replaced each one of these dusty,
          ancient , dirty freeloaders w/a young idealistic conservative in the mold of Jindal.

           I wonder how many other senators and representatives shoud be indicted? I read last
           evening on the internet that the 'save fannie and freddie' was easily passed because they
           give huge sums to the senate and house so it sounds like these individuals pass bills for
           their own good rather than what is good for the country. And this bill certainly was not
           good for the country, people make bad choices should have to pay for their mistakes that
           is how most people learn. Who next will be saved from themselves by the governmenmt?

           If Stevens has any sense of honor left at all, he should withdraw from the Senate race and
           let the Republican party in Alaska name a replacement. He is already trailing in the
           polls. Unfortunately, he will put self above party and the people of his state.

          There may be a silver lining on this, had this come down less than 48 days before the

           He is 84 years old and has been there forever. He shouldn't have been running for
           reelection. I doubt that there is time for the Republicans to recruit a viable candidate
           to hold the seat. The primary is in August but I expect the time for filing has expired.

           Frankly, from what I read in the article, this is pretty small potatoes. It might be
           "unethical" but scarcely "corrupt" in the criminal sense.




          First of all, he appears to have received "matters of value" - consisting of getting free
          work on his home, trading in old cars and getting ones of substantially more value are
          offered as examples.

    I




          He did "favors" for VECO, an Alaskan oil services company by aiding it on its gas pipeline
          project and on foreign projects in Pakistan as one example - and apparently the
          prosecution's claim is that he did for what he received from VECO. Since VECO is a
          American company employing many people and is based in Alaska, why shouldn't a Senator
          from Alaska help it? I notice that nowhere in the article is it claimed by the prosecution
          that he took money bribes. What he did take could easily be construed as gifts - and this
          comes under the jurisdiction of a Senate Ethics Committee - and should not be the subject
          of a criminal prosecution.

          #6--I think the answer is specific to the state, but the general pattern is that the
          governor gets to appoint a temporary replacement, and the place is filled by an election
          held during the next scheduled election, whether it would be "off year" for the position
          or not. If it is an "off year" election, the winner has to stand for election again when
          the regular election for the position rolls around.

           Sen. Stevens needs to resign now, so a strong Republican can run for his seat. Otherwise,
           a Democrat will replace him. The GOP doesn't have Senate seats to burn, especially if
           faced by an Omaba Administration. The Democrats, unbridled by possible filibusters, will
           take the economy and much more down. I don't want to live through another four year
           activist Democrat "progressive" era. Just about everything Obama plans to do will hurt
           this country. If Stevens doesn't step aside now, he'll be hurting the country.
