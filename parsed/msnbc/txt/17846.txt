               Darroll Hargraves will resign from the Local Boundary Commission. This will be another key
               person we can plug in. We still are actively searching for someone to fill the Fairbanks/Interior
               seat.

              Boundary commission makeup shifts
              Staff Report
              Published May 9, 2007
              The faces are changing at the state's Local Boundary Commission.
              Chairman Darroll Hargraves announced last week that he will step down from the
              commission this summer. The news follows the April resignation of Tony Nakazawa,
              who until last month represented the state's Fourth Judicial District - which includes
              Fairbanks - for four years on the commission.
              The Local Boundary Commission considers proposals to create, or alter the boundaries
              of, municipal governments.
              Hargraves, a Wasilla resident, is leaving in order to "seek new business opportunities
              and political options that may be available to me in coming months."
              Nakazawa left the commission April 30. A former director of the University of Alaska
              Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service, he is in the process of moving to southcentral
              Alaska to take a post at the UAF Palmer Research and Extension Center.
              Nakazawa said the commission and its staff have a difficult job. "We're fortunate to
              have those people, the ones that have served before and the ones that will come in the
              future."
