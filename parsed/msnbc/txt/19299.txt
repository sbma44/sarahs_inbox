              Itta DID want the family there- it'd be more offensive to have NOT brought at least one of them
              to such a family-oriented celebration.

               Comparing Murki's travel is key here.

              Also I bet Kris could get Mayor Itta or someone to indicate the desire and/or specific request
              from the community of Barrow for the whole family.

              This is of course ridiculous. The community of Barrow was elated that you and Piper visited.

              Huh? Is he writing a story on the First Family's invitation to attend a native celebration? The
              state only bought one, one-way ticket for only one other member of the First Family (only the
              return flt), as not all 7 of us attended, of course.
              When we're invited to a family event I do road trips when possible, but Barrow aint a road trip.
              They were thrilled at least Piper, could make it out of the first family members.
              And we didn't even spend the night so no hotel!
              And my travel is 1/4 what Murk's was, despite having a large family that's always invited to all
              these Alaskan first family events.

              Subject: Barrow travel

              Governor -

              Just an FYI. I talked with Kyle Hopkins at length about First Family travel. He specifically asked
              about the Barrow trip and why the state should pay for Piper's travel expenses. I explained at
              length that there is a certain obligation.and expectation of the First Family to participate in
              community activities and make public appearances. He said/ will say that I could not give a
              specific regulation that spells out First Family travel guidelines. I told him that it is unfair to ask
              me for a specific regulation - after hours - before a holiday and if necessary, I would call Nizich or
              Linda at home. He said that was walking out the door and he would let his editors know of my
              concerns. I insisted that he - attribute to me, that a regulation exists.
              Hopefully, I will portrayed accurately in the paper tomorrow. Thanks.
