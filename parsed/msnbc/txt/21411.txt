                Alexander Creek is a Native group recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims
                Settlement Act, with corporate status chartered under State law. So, the
                corporation should have a president and board of directors. Joe or Frank may have
                more information on the specific individuals involved and possible meetings. I just
                didn't want you to be surprised by anyone at the AFN Convention.

                Congressman Young may ask the Chairman of the House Resources Committee for
                a hearing on four Alaska bills - an AFN rural development initiative, a new Native
                veterans allotment bill, a Sealaska land exchange, and Alexander Creek. Only the
                development initiative is likely to be non-controversial.

                Neither Congressman Young nor his staff has asked for anything from the State as
                yet. A staffer called on Friday to advise us of a possible hearing on November 14th.

                   I am not been informed of an Alexander Creek mtg. I'll ask Joe if there is progress
                   on this issue regarding any meeting, but I have not been in the loop on it and
                   Young's office hasn't told/ asked me anything about it - so I'm in the dark on any
                   details. In fact, I know about this issue via this email exchange, I haven't had
                   meetings on it.

                   Who would I even be meeting with? The community of Skwetna? Does Alexander
                   Creek have an organized government or Native Corp representing the area?

                    Subject: Alexander Creek Legislation - CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT
                    PRIVILEGE


                    It is our understanding that you may soon be meeting with representatives of
                    Alexander Creek. On Friday, we learned that there might be a House hearing on
                    November 14th on legislation proposed by Alexander Creek to grant them
                    additional lands in the Mat-Su Valley.

                 Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



                    With all of this in mind, and not knowing whether you ever saw my previous
                    email on the Alexander Creek bill, I have attached my earlier email analyzing this
                    legislation and suggesting how we might approach it, at least for the time being.
