              Governor,

              I take responsibility for this going out. I spoke with Bill about it earlier today, but never ran it past you. We
              have been getting lots of pressure from senate dems that are with us, but who want "cover" because they
              are getting calls and emails against AGIA. We rushed on this due to the sense of urgency from the
              senators.

                              LEGISLATIVE ALERT - CALL YOUR ALASKA SENATOR TODAYI


                 Top 10 Reasons to Vote "Yes" on Authorization to Issue the AGIA License to
                      TransCanada Alaska Company, LLC and Foothills Pipe Lines, Ltd.

                1. TransCanada Alaska Company, LLC ("TC Alaska") and its parent corporation,
                   TransCanada Corporation, are high-quality companies in the business of building and
                   operating natural gas pipelines throughout North America.

                2. Through an AGIA license, TC Alaska makes legally enforceable commitments to:
                       Hire Alaskans;
                       Meet in-state energy needs;
                       Adhere to a firm timeline for project development all the way through FERC
                         certification; and
                       Reduce tariffs and increase expansion opportunities that encourage exploration and
                         development of the North Slope gas basin, which provide the basis for long-term
                         careers, economic security and energy security for Alaskans.

                3. If TC Alaska violates any legally enforceable commitments made under the AGIA license,
                     consequences include recoupment of state reimbursements made under AGIA and state
                     acquisition of project data acquired by TC Alaska during the license term.

                4. TC Alaska offers a project that is economically and technically viable , and that maximizes
                   benefits to Alaskans.

                5. TC Alaska faces fewer permitting obstacles in Canada , and, as an independent pipeline
                   company , does not raise the antitrust legal issues that might affect a producer -owned gas
                   pipeline.

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 4



                6. Award of an AGIA license to TC Alaska provides the opportunity to bring all parties together while
                   still protecting Alaska's interests.

                7. Award of an AGIA license does not commit the state to anything more than the inducements
                   specified in the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act:
                       Up to $500 million reimbursement for qualified expenditures;
                       Benefits of an AGIA coordinator and expedited state permit review;
                       Exclusive enjoyment of the AGIA inducements prior to the commencement of commercial
                         operation.

                8. Award of an AGIA license to TC Alaska allows the state to assist smaller pipeline projects that
                   can provide gas for instate needs or spur line projects off the AGIA mainline.

                9. A gas pipeline company owned by major North Slope oil and gas producers, and that is not
                   licensed under AGIA, may be subject to management decisions that reflect the best interests of
                   the owners, rather than the pipeline company. For example, the gas pipeline company may
                   benefit from expanding the pipeline, but if such an expansion competes with producers' interests,
                   the producer-owners may not allow the expansion.

               10. Without authorization to issue the AGIA license to TC Alaska, Alaska will once again be
                   dependent on the major North Slope producers for pipeline development and that means:
                       Project development on the producers' timeline that fits with their worldwide plans;
                       Negotiations on fiscal concessions with the producers holding most of the cards; and
                       Far fewer tools to protect Alaska's interests or to develop Alaska's natural gas resources in
                         a way that maximizes benefits to Alaskans.


                 Call your Alaska State Senator TODAY and urge him or her to vote YES to award the state
                                                 license to TransCanada.
