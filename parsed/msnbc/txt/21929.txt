                 November 19, 2007                         Walt Parker, 907.333.5189 ; Lois Epstein , 907.929.9372

                                  Statewide Poll Shows Little Support for Juneau Road /Ferry Project
                            Alaskans Prefer Local Projects and Will Not Use the Road to Contact Legislators

                Anchorage, AK - A new statewide poll shows that Alaskans prefer by a 79% to 11% margin that the state
                spend money on local transportation repairs, maintenance, and upgrades rather than on the $374 million
                Juneau Road/Ferry Project. The poll also shows that by an even higher margin, 81% to 13%, Alaskans do
                not plan to use the proposed road/ferry project to access the legislature in Juneau. Southeast Alaska
                residents alone backed local repairs, maintenance, and upgrades over the project by a smaller margin,
                63% to 26%. The poll, conducted by Anne Hays Research (www.haysresearch.com), was taken on
                November 9-12 and is available at http://www.aktransportation.orglyress-releases/november-19th-2007.

                The Juneau Road/Ferry Project, a holdover transportation project proposed by the Murkowski
                Administration, consists of 50 miles of new road that would end at a new ferry terminal on the east side of
                Lynn Canal, 18 ferry miles from Skagway. Travelers would then take ferries to Haines or Skagway. The
                proposed road route is along very steep terrain prone to avalanches, rockfalls, and landslides, so a good
                portion of the project will be among the toughest - and most expensive per mile - road construction
                projects in the country.

                "These poll results demonstrate that the Juneau Road/Ferry Project is not a priority for 8 of 10 Alaskans,
                and that almost no one in the state plans to drive to Juneau. Governor Palin should cancel this expensive
                project and use the money for essential transportation repairs and maintenance, which only will increase
                with permafrost melting and increased flooding caused by climate change," stated Walt Parker,
                Anchorage-based former head of the state's Department of Highways (now Alaska Department of
                Transportation) under Governor Jay Hammond.

                Lois Epstein, Director of the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project, a non-profit, statewide
                transportation "watchdog" organization stated that "the legislature needs to hold oversight hearings on
                what would not be funded if the Juneau Road/Ferry project moves forward, including transportation
                projects that would benefit the trucking industry and relieve congestion in and en route to Anchorage."

                Much of the $244 million in currently-unidentified funds for the project will come from the state because
                federal transportation funding is in decline, resulting in Alaskan transportation needs being cancelled,
                delayed, or scaled back to fund the Juneau Road/Ferry project. Using general fund money could affect
                non-transportation priorities, such as funding for education and municipal revenue sharing. Important
                state transportation projects that may have inadequate funding should the Juneau Road/Ferry Project
                proceed include the Glenn/Seward Highway to Highway connection in Anchorage, upgrading the Parks
                Highway to allow for year-round truck travel, and ensuring the safety of existing roads and bridges.

                Hays Research Group conducted the poll as part of a survey of 400 residents statewide, and the margin of
                error is +/- 4.9%. Only approximately I in 10 poll respondents didn't know or refused to answer the poll
                questions.
