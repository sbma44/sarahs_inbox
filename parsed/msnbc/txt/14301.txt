            Press/Alaskans may need to hear about this - it's a major ploy to distract and sink AGIA.

             Governor - the back up was due today but they have had to extend. Latest we heard is that
            we will not get the back up until the bill is transmitted. I do not know when that will
            happen but expect it within the next week to ten days. I believe the legislature will want
            you to have to act while they are in special session.

            about the timeline for the bill before cabinet on Thursday. KJR

              I thought back up info was due today? Also- when can I expect to be handed the budget,
            thus giving me the ticking 20 day clock for vetoes?
