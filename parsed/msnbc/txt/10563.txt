              I've been trying Franci on her cell phone now for awhile, but I'll keep trying and see if
              I can reach Ray Nix. Sorry for the confusion.

             There are two entrances to old glenn. Both far away from each other. Kris-if u have any of
             their cells pls provide to janice or call them to explain its my screw up, I didn't find
             it trying the thru-Palmer entrace. I'm late for Dimond, almost out of gas, so I'm headed
             away from Palmer now.

             Governor - I spoke to them earlier and told them that it was unlikely that you would be
             able to attend. I have tried to call the office and no one is answering. I am under the
             impression that it is 7-8 miles from Palmer on the Old Glenn Highway. Janice

              Old glenn can be accessed by going thru Palmer-(like you were on your way to cemetary or
              Butte - I think the road is Arctic thru Palmer ) or it can be accessed by taking the Old
              Glenn exit off the flats.

              Governor - just spoke to them . Go out Old Glen - Go 7-8 miles and you will come to Yellow
              Blinking Lt. turn Right - continue approx . 3-4 miles and you will come to Spur Rd . - small
              sign probably covered in snow - there is a gate there. Let me know and I can call you to
              walk you through also. Janice
