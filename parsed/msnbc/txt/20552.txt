            Let's get with Revenue in the morning and see if they can expedite the calculation,
            although I'm not sure that they can. But Monday should be a slow news day. Ideas on venue?

            Good point. Let's find a good place then to sign the $1200. When do we find out the perm
            fund amt?

            All,



            The governor would like to sign the energy rebate bill in Kenai this Saturday .             She would
           also like the LG to be present.



            Kate.
