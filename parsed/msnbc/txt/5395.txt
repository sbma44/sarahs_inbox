           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                    07-078

                        Alaska One Step Closer to Its Own Commemorative Quarter

            The new state quarter is part of a 10 - year program started by Congress in 1999 . Coins are
            released every ten weeks in the order states were admitted to the union . Alaska was the 49th
            state admitted to the union in 1959 . Hawaii followed shortly thereafter . The back side of each
            quarter honors that state.

            The Alaska Commemorative Coin Commission submitted five narrative designs to the United States
            Mint. Final designs were selected based on aesthetic beauty , historical accuracy , appropriateness
            and coinability . The four final designs are:

                 A polar bear with the midnight sun
                 Denali National Park with a dog sled musher and the Big Dipper with the North Star
                 A brown bear with salmon and the Big Dipper with the North Star
                 Denali National Park with a gold panner

            Governor Palin is asking for comments from the public before she selects the final design later this
            month.

            "It is important that I hear from Alaskans as we select a coin that will represent our state for many
            years to come ," said Governor Palin. "I applaud the work of the Alaska Commemorative Coin
            Commission and the many Alaskans who submitted their ideas for consideration."

            Pictures of the proposed coins may be found on the State of Alaska homepage . Alaskans may also
            submit comments online . Public comments are welcomed through April 22, 2007.
