                Governor,

                Your three completed picnic binders are on your desk . A few changes worth noting:

                -as DMVA did not have a Corporate Blue Star Banner in Alaska , we are going to have to pass on including that in
                tomorrow's ceremony at the Valley picnic. Also, it would be more appropriate for the American Legion or a
                branch of the military to present you with the flag, so we 'll work that out down the road.

                -in the Valley military ceremony , you will be assisting Bert Hall in handing out the Blue Star Banners to Valley
                military families.

                -l have put speaking points for all three of the picnics on card stock and placed them in your binders , should you
                prefer that format. You have two occasions to speak at the Valley picnic (two sets of remarks included), and one
                occasion at each of the other picnics.

                Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions , or if I can be of further assistance. Have a good
                evening!
