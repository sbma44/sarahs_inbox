              Joe- So how does this work with Ralph Samuels spending three days with FERC in DC
             recently? Any influence there?

              Sorry, I dont know what its about .  I suspect it is one of two things , though.  Either an
             announcement that they are filing paperwork with FERC under the pre - application process or
             that Enbridge is joining the Denali group.

                 They are announcing at 10:00 a.m. which only gave us a 20 minute window to call - 9:00
             -   9:20 a.m . Janice
