           Pat and Mike - in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd , I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks , and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.

                                                                     2

           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event " out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate , and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea , I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past , except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate , hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.



           If this was "hijackiing" it or it was out of line , surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
