         Governor , your sister Molly just called and said that she had tried your cell but was not
         able to get hold of you .  I gave her the Anchorage office and also Kris's direct line.
         She asked if you were all coming down this next weekend as her son will be here playing in
         the football game Friday evening . I told her that you would all be here and was aware of
         the game . She was thinking of seeing if she could make reservations at the Mansion for a
         couple of nights.



         Have you decided what flights you and the family would like to take back to Anchorage on
         Saturday , either early afternoon or late evening. Thank you , Janice
