                   Republic Services adopted a so-called "poison pill measure apparently
                   intended to thwart Waste Management's takeover attempt. Addressing
                   what they called "disruptive and coercive" acquisition tactics, Republic's
                   board of directors adopted a measure that penalizes purchasers of more
                   than 10 percent of the common stock without board approval. However,
                   the board did make an exception for Cascade Investment LLC, Microsoft
                   Chief Executive Bill Gates' investment vehicle, and the Bill & Melinda
                   Gates Foundation Trust which already own 15 percent. They have
                   permission to acquire up to 20 percent, Waste Management recently
                   affirmed its intent to acquire Republic despite these actions. On )uly 24,
                   Waste Management filed papers seeking federal approval of its proposed
                   $6.2 billion takeover of Republic... Read More s


              2.   WASTE MANAGEMENT WILL NOT RULE OUT HOSTILE BID FOR
                   REPUBLIC
                   Without giving specific details, Waste Management reiterated its offer to
                   purchase Republic Services and would not rile out the possibilities of a
                   new offer or hostile takeover. After Republic rejected its $34-per-share
                   ($6.2 billion) all-cash purchase offer, Waste Management filed the
                   necessary Notification and Report Form under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
                   (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in order to purchase a
                   controlling interest through transactions on the market. Waste
                   Management also said that it is in the process of notifying certain states'
                   attorneys general of its HSR filing and of its intent to purchase Republic
                   Services' stock. In response, Republic issued a statement emphasizing
                   that it plans to proceed with its proposed merger with Allied Waste
                   Industries, and that the firm "continues to believe that the merger
                   between Republic and Allied will create significant value-generating
                   opportunities, including significant cost-saving synergies, and is in the
                   best interests of Republic stockholders." Republic added that Waste
                   Management "can only acquire up to $63.1 million worth of Republic
                   common stock without first receiving antitrust clearance from the federal
                   government. "While Republic is aware of our fiduciary duties and will
                   respond to Waste's antitrust notices as appropriate, Republic will
                   continue to guard against opportunistic attempts to disrupt our strategic
                   plans through open market activity or otherwise.".. Read More s


             3. WASTE MANAGEMENT POSTS SLIGHT DECLINE IN SECOND
                QUARTER EARNINGS
                   Waste Management said that one-time items and rising fuel costs caused
                   second quarter earnings to dip slightly. Nevertheless, the company
                   managed to beat analysts' expectations with earnings of $318 million, or
                   $0.64 per share, on revenue of $3.49 billion compared with earnings of
                   $338 million, or $0.64 per share, on revenue of $3.36 billion in last
                   year's second quarter. Fuel costs rose faster than the company's
                   surcharges to customers creating a lag effect that hurt short-term cash
                   flow. Without the unusual items, earnings would have been up by 12.5
                   percent. Even so, CEO David P. Steiner said that he is confident the
                   company will meet the upper end of the range its full-year earnings

               5.   REPUBLIC SERVICES 2Q EARNINGS OFF 29% RELATED TO
                    OHIO LANDFILL
                    Republic Services reported a 29 percent decline in second-quarter
                    earnings owing to environmental remediation costs associated with Its
                    Countywide landfill in Ohio. The company earned $62.3 million, or $0.34
                    per share, on revenue of $827.5 million compared with earnings of
                    $87.2 million, or $0.45 per share, on revenue of $808.4 million in the
                    second quarter of last year. During the quarter, the company recorded
                    an after tax charge of $21.8 million, or $0.12 per share related to the
                    landfill project. Without it, the results would have been inline with
                    analysts' expectations. Moreover, the company remains optimistic and is
                    backing its earlier forecast for annual earnings of $1.78 per share to

                    Covanta Holding Corp. Is benefiting from rising landfill tipping fees,
                    especially in the Northeast where many of its projects are located, and
                    from higher revenues from the electricity produced. That helped increase
                    revenues and earnings by 19% in the second quarter. Net Income
                    climbed to $44.9 million, or $0.29 a share, from $37.7 million, or $0.24
                    a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased to $423 million.
                    Revenues also were helped by acquisitions and higher prices for recycled

              7.    STUDY SAYS LIVESTOCK MANURE COULD MEET 3% OF
                    NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY NEEDS
                    A new paper by researchers at the University of Texas postulates that
                    converting livestock manure into biogas has the potential to meet 3% of
                    North America's entire energy needs while greatly helping to reduce
                    greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers argue that by employing
                    anaerobic digestion to manure, similar to the way in which compost is
                    created, could generate energy-rich biogas. Hundreds of millions of
                    livestock inhabiting the US could produce approximately 100 billion KW
                    hours of electricity, enough to power millions of homes. Processing the
                    manure rather than allowing it to decompose naturally would avoid
                    emissions of the highly potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and

                   Packaging and recyder, Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. said it lost $31
                   million during the second quarter due to higher energy, freight and
                   chemical costs. The loss amounted to $0.12 per share on revenue of
                   $1.84 billion compared with earnings of $15 million, or $0.06 per share
                   on revenue of $1.87 billion in last year's second quarter. According to
                   CEO Patrick J. Moore, We are seeing unprecedented cost inflation. As a
                   result, our second quarter earnings were negatively impacted by higher-
                   than-expected commodity costs including energy, freight and chemicals.
                   We are raising our selling prices to offset this higher cost inflation,
                   restore profit margins, and improve cash flow in the second half of
                   2008."..Read More))

                  quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed about
                  $18 million to'the growth. Some of those acquisitions have helped
                  Stericycle diversify into other countries, including the U.K. and In Latin

                  CELLULOSIC ETHANOL PRODUCTION PLANT
                  BlueFire Ethanol Fuels, Inc. says that it won Los Angeles county approval
                  to build the nation's first commercial ethanol production plant using yard
                  trimmings, paper, wheat straws and other green wastes . The $30 million
                  facility is to be built in Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, near a landfill
                  which already receives about 170 tons of biowaste material, including
                  woodchips, grass cuttings and other organic waste each day. Once
                  operational in late 2009, the plant is expected to produce 3.2 million
                  gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. The company wants to build 20
                  plants across the country in the next seven years, which would
                  altogether produce more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol each

              Per your request here are draft remarks for Saturday afternoon. There will be a few changes, as I'm
              waiting to implement input from Meg and Joe. I can send you a final draft before noon tomorrow.

              Also, a little context: your audience cosists of about 195 supporters of the college, and a handful of
              students. They are an extremely conservative bunch, and were especially interested to hear from you
              because you represent to them the independence that the US needs to adopt in it's'energy policy.

              Please let me know if you have any questions, and I'll get you the final in the morning.

              Joe, Meg, & Sharon,

              I would appreciate your looking over these remarks ASAP. The Governor is speaking to 200 friends,
              supporters , and a few students of Hillsdale College (rural Michigan) on Saturday afternoon about energy.
              I have incorporated the most current info I have about where we are with the Legislature and TC-AK, as
              well as data and info on ANWR, off-shore drilling, etc. I'd appreciate feedback , and I need help fleshing
              out the section about alternative /renewable energy sources in AK. Please get back to me at your earliest
              convenience. Thanks so much!

              P.S. In an op/ed provided to me by our administration, I read that the 2,000 acres we want to use out of
              ANWR's 20 million acres only constitute 1/1,000th of the total area... my limited math skills (and online
              sources) confirmed that it is actually 1110,000th of the total area. That new data is reflected in the
              attached remarks.


                        (1110 000) of 20 million = 2000
