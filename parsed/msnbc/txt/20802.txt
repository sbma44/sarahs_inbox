                                     Palin Calls for a Halt to Offshore Fish Farm Proposal

              September 12, 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today expressed her
              administration 's objections to elements of the federal government's proposal to allow
              decommissioned oil and gas platforms in federal waters to be used for fish farming and other forms
              of aquaculture.

              "Alaska's natural wild fisheries have been well managed on a sustainable basis for years , and are
              critically important to our state 's economy, especially in our coastal communities," said Palin.
              "Disease, parasites, and escapement of non -native stocks from fish farms are just some elements
              of the threat that aquaculture can pose to wild fish stocks."

              Governor Palin's comments came in response to a Minerals Management Service (MMS) proposal
              that would allow offshore oil and gas platforms to be utilized for aquaculture . The Governor
              outlined several specific concerns , including:

               Marketplace confusion about Alaska 's healthy, wild seafood resulting in lost fisheries value to the
              state;

               Disease and parasite transmission;

              Escapes/releases of farmed fish possibly leading to colonization by non -native fish species and
             genetic impacts on native species; and

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 2


                Environmental effects.

               The state of Alaska has consistently requested that authorization of offshore aquaculture be
               considered only after establishing comprehensive biological and socio -economic baselines that will
               allow for a meaningful evaluation of its effects . The proposed rule does not include such
               provisions.

               In a letter to Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthome , Governor Palin requested that offshore
               aquaculture be removed from a list of authorized alternate rights -of-use for decommissioned
               platforms. In a separate letter, Governor Palin asked that the MMS schedule of public hearings in
               coastal states on the proposed rule be expanded to include public hearings in Alaska , where the
               potential for expansion of oil and gas development activity is great. In addition to concerns about
               potential impacts of offshore aquaculture, Governor Palin objected to MMS ' regulatory authorization
               of offshore aquaculture when Congress is considering two bills authorizing such activity.

               'This issue is of such importance to our coastal economy and environment that it deserves a
               thorough and comprehensive review by Congress and should not be authorized through regulation
               by an agency whose primary expertise is energy , not management of marine resources," said
               Palin.

               If Secretary Kempthorne were to move forward with a proposed rule change allowing aquaculture
               activities in offshore federal waters , Governor Palin urged him to prohibit farming of certain species
               such as salmon, halibut and black cod. She further asked the secretary to allow each Individual
               state the ability to decide for itself whether aquaculture should occur in federal waters off its
               shores.
