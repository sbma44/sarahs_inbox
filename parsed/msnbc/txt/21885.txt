                   Subject : Contact information for suggested AGIA' phone calls
                  Governor,
                  Thanks for taking the time to speak with me earlier today. Like everyone, I'm sending up prayers that the
                  legislature does the right thing for Alaska during today 's ACES' debate.

                  During yesterday's phone conversation we discussed the possibility of you making telephone calls to the
                  TransCanada & MidAmerican CEO's , conveying your hope they choose to participate in the AGIA
                  process . Here are more specifics for those phone calls. For your information , the contact information I
                  have for these two CEO's are their work contact information , therefore I would suggest you make these
                  calls early next week. Finally, the messaging suggestions are somewhat tailored to the particular party in
                  order to address issues that I know to be their concerns:

                  1) TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.
                  Hal Kvisle, President and CEO (Kvisle is pronounced KVVISLEE)
                  Corporate Headquarters : Calgary , Alberta , Canada
                  Hal Kvisle ' s Scheduler is Samantha Smith @ Phone # 403-920-2017

                  General Information:
                      I believe you have previously spoken with Hal Kvisle on the phone re: the AGIA process
                      TransCanada's primary contact person for Alaska is Tony Palmer;
                      Tony Palmer's boss, who heads their gasline effort, is Russ Girling, President/Pipelines

                  Corporate Headquarters : Omaha, Nebraska
                  Phone # 402-231-1400

                   General Information:
                       You and I had breakfast with David Sokol in Washington DC in late February and since then I believe you
                        have spoken with him on the phone;
                       David Sokol is one of two CEO's that report directly to Warren Buffet. MidAmerican is a subsidiary of
                        Warren Buffet 's company, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. David is also an owner in Berkshire Hathaway, which
                        is a diversified, privately held company.

                  Once again, Governor, your willingness to assist the AGIA effort is greatly appreciated by your Gasline Team.
