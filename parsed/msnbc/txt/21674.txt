              Not sure what bds are being referred to here . Which bds match up with which people, and
              what are their timelines for appts to be made? Can Kris work with you on some of these
              while I ' m gone - and also run by mike so there ' s no surprises . He can also work with runs
              to make sure legislators know were choosing folks from their districts to score pts with
              them.

              Governor,




              On our discussion yesterday I spoke with Dorothy Larson of DLG. It just isn't going to
              work out for her to catch the next DV Task Force meetings so I'm back to the well talking
              with Paulette Schuerch, Tara, and others about candidates.



              The rest below are still good for your approval.



              Thanks!

                Oh es ..... Kerm mentioned him as well . . . arid he MIGHT be a good candidate for the              Privileged q
                Pnvile ed board that we have not been able to fill.



               Kerm feels that a Chuck Heath should be your official unpaid advisor for all statewide
               game issues.

               Before I forget- my former employee Don Moore ( also former mat su boro manager) will serve
               for us . He's so smart - he'd be perfect at anything tough.
