         It is fascinating to watch the messaging . We have used the messages below -

         and they have been reported. I think the mixing of the messages perhaps

         comes from talk radio and others who think they know what the Governor wants

         (Mat Maid / Creamery Corp / BAC). We will continue to emphasize and just

         stick with the same message to reiterate our intent.



         Thank you!

        FYI.    This guy has sent me a couple of notes in the last two weeks-he

        obviously likes JVT , but I am concerned about the line about helping 5

        farmers .    We need to make sure our message today includes the

        destanilizing effect the elimination of the dairy segment will have on

        the overall agricultural industry ... not to mention the 100+ jobs at the

        creamery.

         Joe,

         I'm a little worried about the way the Governor is handling this mat

        Maid thing . I still have a lot of faith in her and her ideas. But I
                                                              4

        believe that maybe she isn't getting the whole picture on this dairy

        business.

          Dairy nation wide has been supported by government for many decades.

        Now with the ethanol growth the price of feed is going to put a squeeze

        on even the best run dairy's in lower 48. Joe Van Treeck is a very

         capable and honorable man. He has already done miracles keeping Mat Maid

        operating for last 25 years.. He took a lot of heat early on by

         importing milk to keep production up. Through out the years he has

        introduce many innovative products to keep the dairy diversified. I do

        believe that if Joe Van Treeck can't keep Mat Maid going then no one

        can. My point is I don't want to see Sarah get into something which will

        backfire and haunt her for the rest of her administration. Although she

        is quite committed publicly almost Frank like. I do not believe that the

        dairy can once again operate without lots of government dollars. If she

        goes and puts 2-3 million dollars into to save livelihood of 4 or 5

        farmers it will not set very well with a lot of people in the state.

        Also by axing board members that aren't yes men she puts other state

        directors into the position of maybe not being quite candid enough so as

        not to lose their jobs. I don't really believe in the my way or highway

        approach when you are dealing with knowledgeable people . You end up with

        too many yes men and too many failed projects.

         Have a GREAT DAY,
