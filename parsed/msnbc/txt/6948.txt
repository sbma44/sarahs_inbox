             Meg: well obviously want a press release citing our removing Bill from his state service.

             Kris - pls let the commissioner who would hold the umbrella over this council know of my
             action in removing Bill.

              Kris is right. Bill is a member of the AK-Alberta Bilateral Council. This board serves at the
              governor's pleasure. I will draft the letter of removal now and also contact him, and send an
              electronic copy of the letter to the press office.

              Thanks,

               Ivy

                   I just learned that Bill Allen has served, and still serves, on the Alaska-Alberta Bilateral
                   Council. This council is under the purview of Boards & Commissions. In that capacity,
                   Bill Allen (and also Rick Smith) attended the working group meeting in Edmonton in May
                   of 2004. Murkowski attended as well as Greg Renkes and a number of other state
                   officials. I have a list of attendees that I'll be faxing to Kari. The next working group

                meeting was in March of 2006 in Juneau . Both Bill Allen and Rick Smith attended . I will fax a
                copy of that agenda and participants as well.

               In November of 2004, Bill Allen attended the Council of State Governments trip to Thailand with
               Murkowski, Mrs. Murkowski and Margy Johnson . Murkowski was president of CSG at the time.
               Veco sponsored the trip for $15, 000. Documentation will be faxed . Following the CSG trip to
               Thailand, they all traveled to Taiwan.

                Linda Perez should have further details on expenditures , etc. or any domestic travel . Please let
                me know if you 'd like me to follow-up with her.

               Kari - would you document for me the times Bill Allen accompanied Murkowski and/or
               Clark on trips, incl the international travel(s) - some of these also included Margy
               Johnson.

               It will be necessary for you to ask other commissioners/staff for info on this.

               Kris may be able to get some of that info with you. Thank you
