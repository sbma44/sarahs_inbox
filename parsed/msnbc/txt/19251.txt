            Talis- pls have one of your folks draft a short letter      to Exxon

            "encouraging " them to pay the $500mil .   ( See today's ADN story today) we

            need to be on the record as telling them to pay up, end this thing, end

            this misery . Then we're doing a presser on it     ( in fact let's do the

            presser stating I ' ve asked DOL to write this letter).
