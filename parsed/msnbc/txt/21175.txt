             Dear Governor and members of the Disaster Policy Cabinet,

            I apologize for the informal nature of this email, but I have authorized the
            commencement of an expensive project to relocate the AVEC tank farm in Kivalina, and
            in fact have received a " Kivalina Emergency Transfer Plan" (attached) from ADEC
            appropriating $ 25,000 to assist us in speeding up the fuel transfer if necessary. Of
            course , if the plan should be activated , ADEC has informed us that we would be billed
            for any expenditures they might make.

            The crux of the issue is that significant expenditures are being made by AVEC to
            respond to this ongoing disaster and , despite the Northwest Arctic Borough's
            September 25th disaster declaration , there has been no action on the state's part other
            than the above mentioned action by ADEC.

            By the attached latter, I am urging you to please take whatever action is necessary to
            assist AVEC and the community of Kivalina to respond to the untenable situation that
            we are in.

            Sincerely,

            Meera Kohler
