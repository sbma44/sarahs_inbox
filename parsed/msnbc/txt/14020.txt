                Steven Wright is the ADF&G liaison for federal funding I know, and he is also the Southeast
                Alaska AFSCME shop steward for ADF&G. He has ignored my complaints about treaty
                violations. He has ignored my complaint about hostile work environment. He has ignored ethics
                violations. He has ignored my complaints of abuse of Federal funds. He has ignored my
                complaint about Collective Bargaining Aagreement violations. He has ignored perjury by state
                employees in the ADF&G.

                Maybe you are right, and perhaps Steven Wright realty has no clue as to what is going on. He is
                then only one of many with questionable competence, but I think there are some ill motives
                involved. Maybe his interest in the shop steward position is to subvert the contract or law.

                I hear the state is replacing the $7 million federal cut themselves, but the ADF&G is also
                loosing out on some Pacific Salmon Commission funding. I call that a start.


                Best thing is that some fingers get pointed at his inaction now that the ADF&G is loosing some
                large chunks of Federal Funding. I had suggested to the commissioner that I have set this as a
                goal that the Federal Government not support invidious discrimination and thuggery.

                Some DOI EEO people were the first to suggest cutting funds, but they could not take action
                complaints other than to suggest to their supervisors cutting budgets. Gale Norton did send out a
                memo suggesting DOI funded programs comply with EEOC guidelines about the same time I
                was contacting them.


                In one of my "disciplinary meetings" or " investigatory meetings" I read some things from a
                book FIGHTING FAIR (formerly titled FIGHTING WITH GHANDI -not sure of the author)
                which listed several principles . Kim M extracted "Don't avoid Conflict" as something she could
                use to paint me as some conflicting combative person who she had an excuse to not represent.
                She made all sorts of conjectural statements about howl had "Laid awake thinking about this."
                What BS . She did not take note of the "strive for a win-win situations ," and now there are
                becoming some BIG losers.

                So much for the win-win for Kim Metcafe. Maybe she should spend about the same amount of
                time in Prison for fraud as I have in the Federal Courts trying to get her and SOA investigated.
                I think there is some mail fraud there. I think there is a lot of fraud, including Jim Duncan
                ignoring his Conflict of Interest stipulation. And his pretending to be able to represent the
                contract. All the AFSCME folks need to spend some time in prison. I like seeing that Jim Clark
                has agreed to work with DOJ, and they suggest state prosecutions in his agreement . Wouldn't it
                be perfect if they went to a state prison system in AZ instead of a FCI golf camp?


                Her (Kim M's ) conjecture is about all she put on a grievance , no sign of the words hostile work
                environment, work not done as a result, unequal distribution of hours, Layoff issues , illegal hire,
                quid-pro-quo, ethics violation, treaty violation issues, Lacey Act federal felony, retaliation, etc,
                 nothing at all. A balk.

                Steven could have showed up as a rep but did not. I did not even know he was in the building as
                Management would desire . But he knows his role as is everyone in Labor Management and
                Union- Lie, Deny, Fraud and Defraud and subvert the law or contract.

                I am pretty sure some of the feds (DO] auditors) I talked with have checked his work, as I
                pointed them towards him. He might as well be painted in with the same brush as Jim, Kim,
                Dick and Art.

                 of sane salmon management.

                 The SOP says to make sure to hear what people have to say before any discipline. There was a "casual link" on the first letter
                 which acknowledged "reverse discrimination ." EEOC was told there was no "casual link" but the link is actually quite clear in the letter.
                 Someone lied to the EEOC officers (perjury) and it was by mail, so I think that adds another mail fraud. It might have been someone from the
                 Alaska Human Rights Commission where Hayes' wife (convicted/ plead guilty of corruption) worked.

                The tapes I have recorded sound more like extortion and threats than discipline, and I have begun to circulate them to the Federal agencies
                (DOJ, FBI). I have More to transfer to CD which I am not sure if I can do on this computer, but they pretty much sound like threats to drop
                complaints, rather than discipline. I am surprised KimM took no action upon hearing them. I guess if she was smart she would have destroyed
                them.

                By the way, what do you know about D&O 157? My understanding is that it established a group of CEA employees that would conspire and
                retaliate and scheme and update schemes and all the while not violate worker rights. Art had a lot to do with it, Lynn Ate appeared, Dianne
                Corso had some to do with it, all people who I have been sent round and round to ad nauseum. Art seems sensitive about the mention of it, and
                a letter of proffer and cooperative witness among them would probably result in some conspiracy convictions.

                Art says D&O 157 was a good thing (par Arthur) though it was shot down at the Superior court level, and not taken to the Supreme Court by
                the Knowles AG. I have no doubt they carried out their management plans discussed here regardless of respecting what any court said. I have
                seen it.

                htW://www.labor.state.ak.us/iaborr/do/157.htm


                Confidential Employees Association vs. State of Alaska, Derision & Order No. 157 (04/07/1993). Superior Court REVERSED Agency decision and
                order AND REMANDED for a new Agency hearing in case number IJU-93-0656CI on September 1, 1994. On October 12, 1994, the Superior
                Court issued an ORDER OF CLARIFICATION IN 1JU-93-0656CI.

                Funny how you cannot find this case or set of litigants in the court website.

                Arthur seems a bit apprehensive about what he was doing with this case , and when it is brought up on the weblog it touches a nerve I can tell.
                Art seems sensitive about the mention of 157. A letter of proffer to the least culpable of them with an offer to be a cooperative witness
                among them would probably result in some conspiracy convictions.


                Art has now said publicly that Jim Duncan's conflict of interest complaint and stipulation was a public document, and the fact I could not get it
                by asking was an obstructionist tactic. Now that he knows I have seen a copy of it he claims it is confidential and that I stole it. I beleive Art
                 is a true sociopath and whichever story fits at the time is what he uses, without any concept of truth or lies, just what ever works at the time.

                And typical of corruption, Art had his quid-pro-quo political campaign donations for his Murkowski appointment (2x $500 is the maximum,
                I beleive). As well his revolving door job to represent the ACOA which violated the two year conflict of interest policy of the state Executive
                Branch Ethics Act.

                I talked with a Local Agent last month and the discussion inevitably he moved away from the Lacey Act and treaty violations which were
                DOI and NOAA OLE, and towards Labor Relations and Arthur Chance. I accurately described Art as the "Robert Sorich" of the
                Murkowski Administration and showed the Agent a record of the promotion of the person I recorded admitting retaliation (James'Brit'
                Lobdell) . Brit was promoted with a transfer, and the Sitka ADF&G should have been suspicious of this Admin. appointment . Someone there
                knows more about it for sure.

                htto://www.bettergov.or&/pdfs/sorich complaint.pdf

                Brit was promotes during seasonal leave which was unheard of. He was promoted within a week of giving his name to Art in Downtown
                Juneau in Early 2005. 1 described the tape to Art and suggested this was direct evidence of retaliation, and would not be a good thing for his
                case. Art was in charge of reward and punishment and Merit meant nothing in his retaliatory schemes, even though Merit Principle is in the
                contract.

                 These actions ( Executive and Admin Orders) of the Murkowski Administration were not about seeing ethics or collective bargaining or
                 EEOC missions were fulfilled, but of moving and reorganizing it to political contol , and his cheats.. They were about setting up an illegal
                 patronage scheme where people like Scott Ogan or Robin Taylor would pe political shoe-in's regardless of the extreme lack of qualifications.
                 Maybe Jim Clark's cooperation will be of help with investigation of this direction of Murkowski 's corruption in hiring practices.

                 Maybe more on the Attorney General's corrupt bastards later. And that one standing master who thought she would get the judge appointment
                 by conspiracy and fraud with her AG contacts. Eric Stone at the Fairbanks office should look for the phone links between 465-4137 and the
                 Fairbanks courts. It appears the AG assistants ghostwrite findings for the former standing master up there.

                   John,
                   Was this in response to something Stephen wrote to you? I knew Stephen when he worked at DOE and I tried to get him
                   involved in the union but seemed to be aloof. Funny how he did get involved after working a stint at the Office of the Governor,
                   Tony Knowles. Stephen is a nerd, so I imagine he doesn't really understand what you are saying...

                   Hi Stephen-

                   I hear the state is replacing $ 7 million that the Federal Government has removed from the budget . Why the federal budget cuts anyway?
                   Maybe having Jim Duncan and his cronys take over a employee union was something too late to reconsider now. But it will all work out in
                   the end I AM SURE. Not to worry, I will file Jim Duncan' s Conflict of interest stipulations under seal, as it appears to be an illegal
                   contract . Or was it a public document as Art Chance said? This will be to be in front of a Federal Judge who may be concerned about
                   Alaska's treaty violations . Have you talked to Jim about your role yet, and how you will defend yourself ? I remember giving you some
                   information that you would have been required to act on by state statute , but I guess you were familiar with the do -nothing plan.

                   I sent the tapes I recorded of Britt Lobdell admitting to conspiracy and retaliation to the DOJ just shortly before he was demoted and
                   resigned. Is the state trying to make the witnesses like Britt disappear now? Where is Brit Lobdell anyway? He was appareing to take the
                   role to be Bill Milks' star witness . Are you familiar with Bill Milks ' work? And his use of federal money funded schemes? How about
                   Hayward as his criminal client?

                   Have you investigated his (Hayward' s) incursiuons into sleeping girls ' cabins? There was some plant manager concerned about his daughter
                   waking up in the middle of the night with him touching on her . How about the girl he attacked, have you talked with her yet? Maybe it is
                   time if it is not too late. I know there is a no-investigation policy, but now other agencies have stepped in. Maybe you should at least pretend
                   to not be a corrupt bastard. Maybe there are higher authourities doing what you should have done. But Do you ever wonder why or where
                   the state of Alaska comes under such intense Federal Scrutiny ? Do you think it will end soon?

                   I have finally found a copy of Jim Duncan' s file on his conflict of interest complaint and stipulation, which he violated . It explains
                   everything. I will make sure to mention your name to the Federal Judges , as you obviously are a willing and knowing participant as a do-
                   nothing AFSCME shop steward. I am quite excited about testing the power of the courts as I can see that people do hear the complaints I
                   file. And I have learned alot about finess , and of course, I asked for your support so long ago. Perhaps there is no longer a way to heed the
                   things I asked to be considered , and no way to recall our previous communications.

                    How does it feel to be a member of a corrupt organization (AFSCME Local 52) now that the Federal DOJ is taking notice of your fraud ,
                    waste and abuse of federal coffer?

                  I figure six years for you, about the same time I have spent in pursuit of my statutory and contractual grievance. I think there will be others

                  Chance, Dianne Corso, Lyn Ate, Adrienne Snow , and perhaps fourty others from labor relations and personnel will be there to keep you
                  company for those five of ten years. I am arranging this plan for your future with the agents and prosecutors.
