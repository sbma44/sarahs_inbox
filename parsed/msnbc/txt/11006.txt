             May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to
             address it before I leave for Juneau. Update on clean water initiatives/Gillam's efforts
             too?

              I agree. We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I think
              it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change. Tom

             I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in the
             room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
             streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
             understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if, she we held accountable for more deception.
