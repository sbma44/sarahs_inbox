            Governor, I'm meeting with Jim Minnery for coffee Wednesday morning. Since I used to work
            at Family Research Council, I may be able to help you with him. Had a conversation with
            him before he went on Dan Fagan today. I can fill you in on what I said whenever you have
            time. (Reader's Digest version: I warned him that he's being used as a pawn by your
            political enemies and that it has NOTHING to do with abortion.)

            Thank you Russ. The more info I get on this, the better. Lyda was supposed to call me
            today between 3-4 between flights, but I never did hear from her. If she does reach me, to
            chew me out, I'm going to tell her exactly what I think about all this... amazing that
            Tuckerman and her people succeeded to a degree here on putting the burden on us instead of
            her being held accountable. We are receiving great criticism by those who are
            misunderstanding the issue, and the process.

            We've heard very little,     except from some democrat legislators who were

                                                              1

            opposed to the abortion bills being added to the call of the special

            session on AGIA .     Other random responses were that the letter was

            well-received among those who are sick of Lyda's games .... the numbers

            are MANY.



            I will reach out to the legislators you've mentioned below and see if

            they have thoughts to share regarding this issue.

            I sent this to Sean:      and have u guys heard what lawmakers want us to do

            with abortion bills?



            Ltgov: I'm waiting to hear from friendly leggies on what they'd like to

            see us do with calling for session on abortion bills. If/when called, it

            will be in Anchorage. And very short in duration. Any advice on this to

            add to what Coghill, Dyson, Dallstrom, et al may share?
