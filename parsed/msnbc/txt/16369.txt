                Governor and Mike,

                I have to attend a Senate Judiciary hearing this morning on AGIA and will not be able to attend
                the cabinet meeting. I'm sorry for missing it.

                Mike, please let me know if there is anything I need to follow up on. Thanks.

                -Pat

                Importance: High

                In follow-up to Monday's meeting, there was consensus that the messaging regarding in-state gas needs to step
                up. There are obviously a lot of misconceptions (or lack of information ) of the Administration 's position on this,
                accusing the Governor of flip flopping , no longer supporting an Alaskan line, etc . The Governor is inquiring on
                the status of said messaging . Each day there continues to be news that furthers these misconceptions . Please let
                me know.

                Also, the Governor received a strong letter from Governor Hickel today requesting a meeting with her. I'm
                working on scheduling that for Tuesday ; likely late morning . She would like Marty and Tom to be there . Please let
                me know if there are any conflicts on that day /timeframe.

                Thanks,
