           Sorry, I just noticed that I didn't send 'reply to all'.

           They were shipped out sometime in January. Thanks!

           Ask Todd if he needs them shipped or can wait until I bring them- for free- on thursday. I
           did not know we didn't have that bookcase full of the manymore.

            Todd and Willow will be visiting classroom ( s) on Wednesday , maybe one

            day before that too. We ' ll look for bookmarks for them to hand out in

            the Anchorage office , and we'll need a load of those kid books from the

            mansion to be transported here so we have them to distribute outside of

            Juneau ( that can wait until we can load them in the king air). Pls note

            on sched what they ' ll be doing for First Family event ( s) this week.

            Thanks
