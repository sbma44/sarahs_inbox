Sarah et al, I am getting more info from my clients saying the oil industry

is really gearing up local "business leaders" to oppose AGIA. They are

having a big lunch this week all organized by Jim Jansen from Lynden (one of

our arch enemies in the campaign) I am suggesting a press conference by

sarah in advance of this saying she is aware this is going on and that the

boards of these organizations need to consider the will of the people before

they take any traitorous actions.



The election was a referendum on the stranded gas act and the producers

monopoly over the gasline and the people clearly spoke. This clearly is a

turning point for Alaska, just like wally said in his oped on Sunday. The

choice will be whether alaska charts its own destiny or whether we will be

dictated to by outside corporations, just like we were when the outiside

fish companies controlled alaska. That's why we fought for statehood in the

first place.



They will pull out all the guns for the finance committees which will be our

toughest committees. I have heard they are planning to fly in employees and

other businesses to testify.



I will write more as I hear it.
