         Subject: Kvisle quote



         There was a quote from Hal Kvisle in the Daily Globe and Mail today saying the project
         would go forward when Exxon is happy.



          It was a poor quote and even worse timing.   Legislators are upset and some of our
         opponents (notably Bob Roses ) are trying to stir up trouble.

           TC is getting a letter of clarification from Kvisle right now.   What we have told
          legislators is that this isn't really new: everybody is going to have to be happy,
          including Exxon.
