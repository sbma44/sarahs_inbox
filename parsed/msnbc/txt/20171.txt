             Governor,

             Here are your remarks and event info. I'm still waiting on feedback for the remarks from several in your
             Juneau office, so there may be changes yet, as Janice may have mentioned. I've told them I need to get
             the remarks to you as early this evening as possible. I've reworked the remarks, integrating several
             comments from Rhonda McBride. I will have Tara print your speech off on cards for you tomorrow
             morning, as I have jury duty first thing. Yay for civic responsibility© Anyway, I'll get updated remarks to
             you ASAP, and please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any
             further assistance.

             Thank you!
