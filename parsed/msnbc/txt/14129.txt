                I thank you so much for pulling this together. You are a professional and giving person. Your name is so
                respected and we look up to you too. It was a educational and for me a emotional caring time in my life. We have
                Lorrie too and your mom was dynamite.

                 Southeast Alaska Native Women's Conference that begins today; $25 registration - there are
                 limited scholarships! I am forwarding you a copy of the wonderful program for the next three
                 days featuring speakers such as Florence Sheakley, Laird Jones, Ruth Demmert and panel:
                 Alberta Aspen, Corrine Ragu and Micalyn Kunz McGhee, Iva Graywolf, Healing Ceremony,
                 and a number of others. Iva will be speaking about suicide prevention. Hopefully our local
                 Native organizations will allow interested staff to participate in this conference and support
                 our local ANS Camp 2.

                 The theme for the conference speaks for itself, "Making a Difference: Knowledge of Our
                 Mothers keeping our Culture alive". The conference pays tribute in many different and
                 creative ways; something you don't want to miss out on! Please see the various forms that
                 come with the packet.

                 If you know of any person who would be interested in attending this conference please share
                 the news; we need community support. There is a welcome dinner planned this evening; we
                 are going to cook: Grilled King Salmon, Roast Pork, rice, buttered corn, salad and a dinner
                 roll. Dessert too! Come and visit; bring those special people in your life; grandmother, mom;
                 tell your family! Let's make a difference together.
