            Governor & Mike:

            I didn't want to send this to everyone else... Part of the problem is the DOT/PF needing
            to FOLLOW THE CONTRACT. I have Nancy Sutch dogging them whenever I hear about a ferry
            system disruption, but sometimes they move forward without consulting us and we end up in
            this kind of situation.  Hopefully, we are pulling in the same direction now.

            ak

            I'll work with Mike and Annette - clearly, this happened a long time ago - and we are
            working to get better language in the contracts so we don't end up in this same situation

            We'll need a better explanation for the public's understanding (than what was reported in
            news )... as I don't believe the story explained that this was not our doing, nor our
            choice to pay out these union demands. Thanks

            Governor - the funding in the supplemental request is based on an arbitration decision for
            monetary damages payable to the union for alternate service following the grounding of the
            LeConte in 2004 . We did not receive the decisions in time to address this last session,
            so they are in the FY2008 supplemental request we submitted to the legislature.

            Talis- did Mike get a chance to talk to you about this after my response to his question
            on EVOS yesterday? I'll forward my response to you that I'd sent him. I will defer to the
            board's desire to proceed on evos projects , based on my assumption that we've studied each
            proposal and its the prudent (and fiscally conservative thing) to do - but for the record
            I do not know what the proposals, projects or purchases are.



            Also- Annette or whomever can answer: Juneau Empire reports on a nearly $500g settlement
            from ,04 ferry grounding... it's in our budget - but I have not been told of this.- if I
            am asked I do not have an answer. Please explain before I am asked. Thanks

            Dear governor palin.   Larry Hartig. Denby Lloyd and I have been meeting all day Saturday
            and today in preparation for a trustee meeting tomorrow. Monday. On the agenda tomorrow
            are several votes on habitat acquisition of several parcels for several million dollars.
            We will be asked to vote. These funds are from a habitat acquisition fund. The trustees
            have been making such purchases for years. Can the 3 of us get the green light to act in
            our best judgment tomorrow which in most of these would be to vote for the purchases? Can
            you just email the three of us a yes to proceed as we see approriate on these parcels. We
            are reluctant to vote until we know you have no philosophical objection. Talis,
