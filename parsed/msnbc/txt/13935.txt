             Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill

             McAllister, Stephen M., Kristin?? On the second floor about the capital

             budget - told them there are significant items missing that are basic

             health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some examples

             like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big

             differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED

             grants - approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly

             there has to be a responsible budget by the end and that we will

             continue to work toward that.



            They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental -

             told them we still have a few more meetings with legislators - that I

            didn't think we would be able to do much before Thursday -

            We need to do it sooner . Senate just had their press avail and we can't

             let their issues go unanswered for another two days . Mike and I are

            working on it.

             I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

             could cover budget items as well as CON.

             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list

             that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

             screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

             to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

             outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
