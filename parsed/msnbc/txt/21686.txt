             Governor,



             Want to make sure I didn't miss a green-light email on the rest these open board spots
             with recommendations below.   I have made contact with Wes Keller & Dyson's office and Wes
             in particular has some thoughts on the DV task force. Dan Jarrell also called
             recommending Barbara or Mike Curtis for the open clergy spot on the Suicide Prevention
             Council which I have to research out more.



             The spots below are:

             North Pacific Research Board

             Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery

             Commission on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault

             Suicide Prevention Council

             Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee

             Seismic Hazards Safety Commission

             Governor,




             On our discussion yesterday I spoke with Dorothy Larson of DLG. It just isn't going to
             work out for her to catch the next DV Task Force meetings so I'm back to the well talking
             with Paulette Schuerch, Tara, and others about candidates.



             The rest below are still good for your approval.



             Thanks!

             Oh yes..... Kerm mentioned him as well. . .and he MIGHT be a good candidate for the
                                                                                                       Privileged c

             Kerm feels that a Chuck Heath should be your official unpaid advisor for all statewide

             Before I forget- my former employee Don Moore (also former mat su boro manager) will serve
             for us. He's so smart- he'd be perfect at anything tough.
