            Governor,

            Sharon is interested in going to Petersburg b/c this will be her last weekend in SE for a while and also wants to
            attend the dinner on the cruise ship w/ all of us on Sunday night. So... if there's not room for you, me, Pipe, Cora
            AND our good friend Sharon then I'll stay back so she can go and take care of all of the media stuff.
