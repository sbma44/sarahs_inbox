          Sharon - did Mike or anyone give you a head ' s up this was coming , in case I was asked about
          illegal earmarks or any other aspect of Stevens' woes lately ... In light of the Stevens
          issues we dealt with all last week I'd think whomever received the letter ( to me ) on Sept
          14 would have disceminated the info so we could be prepared to talk about it in the
          context of the Stevens issues we were already dealing with.



          Kris or Frank - did u get anything on this?

          Im reading today's article, ADN, about Penney's earmark from Stevens - it says the
          governor received a letter Sept 14 questioning the funds. Was that me, or was some letter
          sent Sept 14 during prior administration?



          Because i have not seen, nor heard about, any letter. In fact, except in passing when I
          heard Larry and Mike mention the ADN was on to another Stevens/Penney issue, I have never
          been informed nor privy to any info on this issue.



          I feel I need to be informed of these issues that deal with the state and end up on the
          front page of the newspaper. Please, if that letter was sent to me, allow me to see it. I
          would think I'd be asked about this issue, and we're lucky I wasn't already asked when a
          couple of reporters stopped me last week for Stevens' issues/comments.
