               ISER Research Matters No. 28 . Alaska's Construction Spending : 2008 Forecast
               February. 4, 2008

               Construction spending in Alaska will total about $7 billion in 2008 , down 2% from 2007 , according to the
               new construction spending forecast by Scott Goldsmith and Mary Killorin of ISER. The forecast is
               prepared annually for the Construction Industry Progress Fund and the Associated General Contractors
               of Alaska . Other findings include:

                    At $4.6 billion , spending by private industry will make up 66 % of total 2008 construction spending.
                      Private-industry spending is up 2% from last year , with projected growth in the oil and gas, mining,
                     utilities, and other basic sectors.
                    Public agencies are expected to spend $2 .4 billion , or 34% of total construction spending . That's a
                     drop of 8% from 2007 , mostly because the federal government will spend less for military
                     construction in Alaska this year . Construction spending by state and local governments is expected
                     to increase about 12%.
                    The oil and gas industry will spend the most-about $2.9 billion , or 5% more than in 2007. That
                     spending alone accounts for $4 of every $ 10 in construction spending . Most spending will be on
                     the North Slope , but something in the range of 10% will be in Cook Inlet.
                    Residential construction spending is expected to drop 35% in 2008 . But unlike in many parts of the
                     U.S., the drop is not due to problems associated with the sub-prime mortgage market. It's mostly
                     because housing prices in Alaska have been rising faster than incomes-so the supply of houses
                     exceeds the demand. That's a temporary imbalance , because Alaska's housing market is basically
                     sound . Housing construction will slow down until demand can absorb the excess supply that
                     accumulated in 2007.
               Copies of the forecast are available online from ISER and the Associated General Contractors
               (www.agcak.org).
