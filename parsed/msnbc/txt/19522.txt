              Subject: Exxon

              Dear Governor Palin,
                   Today Exxon filed a Response to the plaintiff request for a court ruling that interest is due on the
              judgment. In their arguments , which are certain to further enrage plaintiffs Exxon , among other things
              states:
                        ... Exxon does not agree that there is any sound basis to award plaintiffs what they seek -
                       approximately $488 million over and above the 507. 5 million ...
                       "... all plaintiffs here were fully compensated years ago; no plaintiff has any type of personal or
                       property right to be paid punitive damages..."
                       "There is also no reason to penalize Exxon by awarding another $488 million (interest claimed)
                       in damages..."

                        Most incredibly the following statement is in their argument today:

                             "Absent plaintiffs ' inciting the district court to ignore the Ninth Circuit's rulings, this case
              might have been concluded years ago.'


                        "Plaintiffs won nothing like a `clear-cut victory here."
                        "... the Court should include in the judgment interest only from the date (June of this year) of
                        this Court's judgment fixing the legal size of the punitive damages award."


                So it continues .... It is no wonder people hate attorneys. Talis

              WASTE MANAGEMENT OFFERS TO BUY REPUBLIC SERVICES FOR
              $6.19 BILLION

               Waste Management launched an unsolicited surprise counter offer to buy
               Republic Services for about $6.19 billion , potentially derailing Republic's
               deal to acquire Allied Waste Industries Inc. for $6 .77 billion . Republic said
               in a statement that it would carefully review the proposal and respond in
               due course, but the company noted that it already had a definitive merger
               agreement with Allied Waste . Waste Management's bid of $34 per share
               represents a 22% premium to Republic's recent closing price, but that stock
               had been off by 17% since rumors of its deal to buy Allied first surfaced.
               Therefore, It is likely that Waste Management will have to sweeten its offer
               before all Is said and done.
               It Is also likely that the greater level of overlap between the two companies'
               markets will necessitate some divestitures; however, according to Waste
               Management's Chairman and CEO , David Steiner, "we're also certain the
               assets we'll get to keep are significant and make for a compelling
               transaction." Republic's strong business in Las Vegas Is an especially
               compelling asset, said Steiner . Even with divestitures, the merger is likely
               to result In an expansion of Waste Management's share of the $55 billion
               waste management industry to 30% from 24%.
               According to Steiner, "Our proposal dearly offers a better and more certain
               value alternative to Republic stockholders than the recently announced
               Republic-Allied Waste transaction."
               Waste Management is drawing strength from its own recent performance.
               The company said it expected to report second-quarter earnings of between
               $0.61 and $0 .62 per share, excluding special items, exceeding analysts'
               average estimate of $0.58 . Revenue rose 3 .9% to $3.49 billion during the
               quarter from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $3.43 billion ...Read
