           Hello,

           Who should I coordinate this with to find out details such as time, guest count, and how
           we'd like to extend the invitation(s)?

           Thanks,

           Erika

           Let's do it. Todd and Trig arrive this aft so it'll be the nice family/Alaskana setting
           too.

          I think it is a great idea. Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA pre-briefing at the
          mansion in January V.

          How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of them will be in
          Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have made ourselves available in such
          a setting for a long time - we need to!

            Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum they can
          appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like the gov's house events
          they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.

          Thanks
