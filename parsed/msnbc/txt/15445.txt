             MIDDLE EAST TRIP

             On May 16, Secretary Spellings became the first U.S. Secretary of Education to visit the United Arab
             Emirates (UA.E). Over the course of her five-day visit, the Secretary met with leading U.A.E.
             officials (including Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, her counterpart,
             Minister of Education Hanif Hassan, and Minister of Higher Education Sheikh Nahyan bin
             Mubarak Al Nahyan), visited three colleges (the American University in Dubai [AUD], the American
             University of Sharjah [AUS], and Zayed University), and, in a culminating event, signed a special,
             five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Dr. Hassan to encourage greater educational
             cooperation and exchange between the two countries. "The U.S. and the U.A.E. share more than
             just a first name," she said at AUD's commencement ceremonies, where more than 400 students
             received their graduation certificates. "We are united in out strong belief in education. And, we
             have made parallel journeys to improve our schools at every level. In this competitive century,
             change happens, whether we are ready or not." The first area of focus for the MOU is math,
             science, and language studies. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             NCLB UPDATE

             Earlier this year, the Secretary announced a differentiated accountability pilot program that would
             allow states to distinguish between low-performing schools in need of dramatic interventions and
             those that are closer to meeting the goals of No Child Left Behind. The law currently treats all schools
             in improvement alike . The pilot would allow states to vary the intensity and type of interventions to

             match the academic reasons that led to a school's identification for improvement And, in states with a
             significant percentage of schools identified, it would allow officials to target interventions and resources to
             schools most in need of reform. Seventeen states submitted proposals for consideration: AK, AR, FL, IN,
             LA, MD, NJ, NY, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, TN, and VA for implementation in the 2008-09 school year and
             GA and IL for implementation in the 2009-10 school year. After reviewing the proposals for four basic
             eligibility criteria, the Department has submitted all 17 states to a peer review panel. The panel will meet in
             June to evaluate the proposals using the agency's guidance
             (http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec         d/daguidance.doc). After considering the peers' comments, the
             Secretary will approve up to 10 states to participate in the pilot. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE
             GO TO htt ://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/differentiatedaccountability/.

             Earlier this month, the Department published a statistical summary of Highly Qualified Teachers (HQTs)
             with three state data tables. During the 2006-07 school year, 94% of core academic classes in the nation's
             schools were led by HQTs. A higher percentage of classes were led by HQTs in elementary school (96%)
             than in secondary school (93%). Also, at both levels, classes in low-poverty schools were more likely to be
             led by HQTs than were classes in high-poverty schools. The percentage of classes led by HQTs has
             increased seven percentage points since 2003-04. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             Meanwhile, the Department has published Fiscal Year 2008 guidance for Title V, Part A of the No Child Left
             BehindAct (State Grants for Innovative Programs). The paper addresses the impact a lack of FY 2008
             funding under Tide V, Part A has on various flexibility provisions of the law and key requirements under the

             STUDENT LOAN ACCESS

             On May 21, as part of its ongoing commitment to make sure students have access to federal student loans in
             the coming academic year, the Administration announced a four-part plan aimed to improve the functioning
             of the student loan marketplace and provide liquidity and stability in the near term. This plan includes: (1) a
             loan purchase commitment by which the Department agrees to purchase new federal loans originated for
             the 2008-09 school year (with the price of the loan equal to the sum of par value, accrued interest, the 1%
             origination fee paid to the agency, and a fixed amount of $75 per loan) and a facility for providing short-
             term liquidity to lenders lacking access to affordable capital due to disruptions in markets; (2) a commitment
             to continue working with the lending community, to explore ways to reengage markets; (3) a strengthened
             "lender of last resort" program to help protect students from shifting market forces; and (4) increased Direct
             Loan capacity, should it be needed to act as an extra cushion for students. "We want students to be able to
             concentrate on their studies, rather than worry about disruptions in the market and whether they will be able
             to obtain federal loans to help pay for school," Secretary Spellings said in a statement. "At the same time...
             we can also consider this a teachable moment that speaks to broader, long-term flaws in our complex and
             outdated financial system." FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             to refine the pricing and conditions of these options to ensure they meet the requirement that they result in
             no net cost to the federal government Final terms will be published in the Federal Register.)

              "The National Indian Education Study" (NIES) is a two-part study designed to describe the condition of
              education for American Indian/Alaska Native students in the U.S. (NIES was first conducted in 2005.)
              Part I, released last week, presents detailed information on the academic performance of American
              Indian/Alaska Native students on the 2007 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) reading
              and math tests. In both fourth- and eighth-grade, the students had lower average scores and proficiency
              rates compared to all other students in the country and, aside from fourth-grade math, showed no
              significant change since 2005. Yet, their performance was not significantly different than the scores for all
              racial/ethnic groups (even exceeding the scores of African-American students on math). In both grades and
              subjects, American Indian/Alaska Native students also performed better if they attended schools with
              smaller concentrations of similar students (less than 25) and attended a public school - versus a Bureau of
              Indian Education school. Part II, to be released this summer, is a survey of the educational experiences of
              American Indian/Alaska Native students, focused on the integration of native language and culture into
              school and classroom activities . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

                    Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD), studied the implementation of
                    the agency's Smaller Learning Communities (SLC) discretionary grant program. On the one hand, the
                    data suggests an upward trend in the percentage of SLC students participating in extra-curricular
                    activities, ninth-graders being promoted to tenth-grade, and graduating students planning to attend
                    either two- or four-year colleges, as well as a downward trend in the incidence of violence. On the
                    other hand, there were no significant trends observed in academic achievement.

                    (http://www.nsf gov/news/news_ summ.jsp?cntn_id=111514) show not only improved proficiency
                    among all elementary and middle school students but also a closing of the achievement gaps between
                    both African-American and Hispanic students and white students in elementary school math and
                    between African-American and white students in elementary and middle school science.

                    for Education Statistics (NCES), indicates that the percentage of public school math and science
                    teachers who left teaching did not change measurably between 1988-89 and 2004-05 , even as the
                    percentage of other public school teachers who left teaching did. When asked to rate various reasons
                    for leaving teaching, greater percentages of math and science teachers than other teachers rated better

             "Education, in my opinion, is the key to democracy. It paves the way for a better understanding of the
             preset of principles acquainted with the democratic procedure. This, in turn, allows people to appreciate the
             benefits that come with democracy for both citizens and leaders of countries anywhere around the
