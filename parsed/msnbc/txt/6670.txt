              Alan stopped in today to sign the resignation letters. We can now move forward with sending nominations back

              North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission : Submit one nomination . We were considering Privileged Because
              this appointment comes directly from the president it could take some time to get the new person appointed. Alan
              said it took two years before he was officially appointed . An acting board member selected from the Commission
              served until he was appointed.

              Be '                 U.S. Advisory Board: Submit two nominations. We were considering Privileged or Person
             and Privile ed or      One has to be a preferred choice. Travel and lodging expenses for this board can't be paid
             through the Office of the Governor. Earl Kreiger in ADF&G manages a federal grant that is used for travel to board
             meetings.
