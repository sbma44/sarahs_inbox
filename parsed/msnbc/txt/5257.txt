                 Okay! Will someone have briefing points for the Governor that I can give her Tuesday a.m.? (Monday is a holiday
                 remember). Sharon, you worked with Sharon Busch to reserve the Conference room, right? Kari.

                 Hey Folks:

                 We are hoping to have Governor Palin sign HB 69 and SB 46 Tuesday at 12:30 in the 3rd floor conference room.
                 Please let me know if there are any major conflicts!

                 Thanks,
                 Sharon
