           Has kelly seen the legislature-type events here requested? And hopefully people will
           understand all tiem contraints this week as I go through the 900 AGIA pages in addition to
           budget work.

           I'd like to do the military things- don't know when yet tho. What's the content of the
           Marine's event? (What will I be talking about to them?) Remember I do the firefighters
           conf before one of the new military requests that must have just come in...

           Judges interviews have to be short, concise timeframes between interviews.

           The days between now and when I leave for Juneau will be packed- esp this week will last
           week of public school events also- pis bear that in mind- Trig also has cadio appt(s) this
           week.

           K- pls print out what the sched looks like

           Governor - I have listed out scheduling requests -



           Dan Sullivan called to request a meeting with you. I told him that due to Budget and AGIA
           that the schedule is pretty full this week.  He would welcome a (5 min.) phone call with
           you on ANGDA - he just wants to share an idea that he has.

           Contact:    Dan Sullivan 907-744-4283
