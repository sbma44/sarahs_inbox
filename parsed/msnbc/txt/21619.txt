              Governor,



              On our discussion yesterday I spoke with Dorothy Larson of DLG. It just isn't going to
              work out for her to catch the next DV Task Force meetings so I'm back to the well talking
              with Paulette Schuerch, Tara, and others about candidates.



              The rest below are still good for your approval.



              Thanks!



              F

              Oh yes ..... Kerm mentioned him as well... and he MIGHT be a good candidate for the Privile ed 0
                         oard that we have not been able to fill.



              Kerm feels that a Chuck Heath should be your official unpaid advisor for all statewide
              game issues.

             Before I forget - my former employee Don Moore ( also former mat su boro manager ) will serve
             for us. He's so smart - he'd be perfect at anything tough.
