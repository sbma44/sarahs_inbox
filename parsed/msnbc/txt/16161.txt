             Governor - I received an email from Commissioner Kreitzer who said that she spoke with you
             yesterday, Monday, 06.16 regarding a 30 minute presentation that she would like to show
             you along with her ETS folks regarding a software program. Mike has seen some of the
             presentation and has some questions that have not been answered. The recommendation is
             that the Commissioner do the presentation with the COS and Anna Kim. At that point a
             briefing paper can be done and presented to you with the pros and cons of the program. I
             do not think you need to sit down with this presentation at this point.
