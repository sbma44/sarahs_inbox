           Governor, for you info. I gave this presentation at the end of the Cabinet meeting today . I believe you had to step
           out. LEO


           In response to the deck truss bridge collapse in Minnesota earlier this week , the DOT&PF Bridge Section has
           examined our bridge inventory and found six structures of similar (deck truss ) construction . All six of these
           bridges will be inspected by September 1, 2007 as part of our on -going inspection program . The six deck truss
           bridges in Alaska include:
                   Kuskulana River Bridge on the McCarthy Road
                   Robertson River Bridge on the Alaska Highway
                   Susitna River Bridge on the Denali Highway
                   Nenana River Bridge at Moody on the Parks Highway
                   Big River Center Crossing Bridge in Icy Bay
                   Big River West Crossing Bridge in Icy Bay
           Please let me know if you have further questions.
