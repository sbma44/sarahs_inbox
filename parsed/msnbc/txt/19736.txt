           Ladies,

           I did not respond to him, at the bottom it says not to respond to him. Please let me know
           if you think differently.

           MESSAGE:

           As a contributor to the letters to the editors in Alaska newspapers I have changed my
           opinion of Sarah. There is no way that she will ever convince ANYone that she did not
           abuse her power and then lie to cover it up. It was sad to see her try to explain it away,
           she was obviously stumbling for words and her demeanor was one of a child caught getting
           into no-" no's. What we all witnessed was embarassing to say the least. It is unlikely
           that she will win re-election as a result. As for being V.P., forget it. This thing is
           going to destroy her "Cinderella Story" as her opponents and former collegues are planning
           a major assault. If Sarah would have done the right thing, she could of turned this
           situation into a good one. That chance is gone. It is a sad day for Alaska. Please dont
           respond.

               How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of
               them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have
               made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!
                 Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum
               they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like
               the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.
