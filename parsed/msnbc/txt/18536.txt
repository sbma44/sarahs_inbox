        Governor, I added Franci to your contact list with email and contact numbers. I also
        called her to relay your message. Franci said to "Thank you" for all you do for the
        Agriculture in Alaska.



        I wanted to update you on flights that you had requested from Juneau to Skagway and maybe
        Haines.  You had asked to come back to Juneau the evening flight on Monday, 09.17.07. You
        would then need to get to Skagway to speak at the Southeast Conference on Tuesday,
        09.18.07 by noon.  Juneau to Skagway: 10:15 a.m. - 11:15 a.m. arrival. You could then
        return Skagway to Juneau: 3:40 p.m. - 4:40 p.m. then Juneau/Anc evening flight. This
        would be on Wings of Alaska. We can not get you to Skagway and then have any time in
        Haines but for 1 hour on the return portion.




        Barrow Flights for Thursday, 09.20.07 - (Honored guest - North Slope borough Oil and Gas
        forum).   Anchorage to Barrow: 6:00 a.m. - 10:36 a.m. (2 stops). Barrow to Anchorage:
        7:55 p.m. - 10:58 p.m. This would put you into Barrow for all day. If you wanted to go
        from Fairbanks then the early morning flight would only have (1 stop) leaving Fairbanks at
        7:38 a.m.

        Thanks, Janice

        Subject: Mat maid




       J- pls note for sched I ran over to MatMaid during their lunch hour so I could say hi to
       employees.




       It was a nice and uneventful visit and tour of plant, considering the fuss they made last
       time I tried to visit. No hairnet or paper shoes were even required, no CEO accompaniment
       was required, etc.



       Pls pass on to Franci Havemeister so she'll know, in case critics try to make something
       out of my short and sweet "pop-in" to the plant, so that I could say hello to employees.
                                                               1
