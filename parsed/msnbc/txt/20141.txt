           Let's just quickly put something out based on what I heard in his speech

           this morn, Rush and others have replayed. Just say we're glad he agress

           with what we've accomplished with AGIA.    He knows we need nat gas

           pipeline, he wants to work on it.

           So far, here's the only quote I have been able to find:



           From Obama's "New Energy for America " plan, at

           http://www.barackobama . com/pdf / factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf



           "Prioritize the Construction of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline. As

           president, Obama will work with the Canadian government ,       state of

          Alaska, oil and gas producers, and other stakeholders to facilitate

           construction of the pipeline. While this pipeline was proposed in 1976,

           and Congress authorized up to $18 billion in loan guarantees for this

          project in

           2004, there has been no progress in building this critical energy

          infrastructure under the Bush, Administration. The planned pipeline would

          have a daily capacity of 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or almost
                                                           2

          7 percent of current U.S. consumption . Not only is this pipeline

          critical to our energy security , it will create thousands of new jobs."



          This isn't much to respond to, but I will keep scouring the net.

           I've been monitoring the 'net to see what he says today (TC folks have

           been working on his campaign people and were hoping / expecting him to say

           something positive about the Legislature ' s action).



           I'm on it.

           He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole

           out Energy Rebate $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking

           points , etc. So .... we need to take advantage of this a write a

           statement saying he ' s right on . .( Glad he's flipflopping on OCS, too.)

           Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction" to

           some of Obama's good points this morning?
