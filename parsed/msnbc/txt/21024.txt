          OK thanks, I will talk to Karen. Did you see how Begich is requesting an additional 20
          new officers in his budget? Interesting move on his part, knowing that 20 officers will
          have a significant impact the DA's, defense attorney (who are already requesting $2
          million), courts and prison beds. The article states that the Mayor's budget calls on the
          state to pay for projects such as $2 million for the Anchorage Golf Course and $4.4
          million for the Anchorage Museum. I guess he did not learn his lesson the first time.

          Karen and I have expressed that even if approved, we will not be able to do everything at
          once .   Shortly after the cabinet meeting , Karen's staff sent out an email to all
          commissioners requesting that they list their absolute must haves, prioritize those and
          show how those priorities can be phased in over 3 to 5 years .        Walt was absent but his
          staff does have the instructions and should be working to meet our Oct 8 deadline to hear
          back from the agencies .        We will have to prioritize his items along with everyone else.
