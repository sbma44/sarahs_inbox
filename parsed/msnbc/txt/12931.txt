                 NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Johnson Honored at Annual Indian Women's
           Luncheon




                 WASHINGTON-March 5, 2008 National Congress of American Indians Executive Director

                 Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) spoke of the many accomplishments of Johnson, who is
           of the Raven/Sockeye Clan of the Tlingit Tribe of Alaska. "Jackie wears many hats,
           juggles many balls, as we all do, but what matters is if you can catch them at the end of
           the day, and Jackie does," Sen. Murkowski said.

                 A banquet room filled with Native women , stood in ovation as Johnson walked to the
           podium to accept a plaque in recognition of her leadership, a Pendleton blanket, and gifts
           from others in attendance. Also in attendance were Native men showing their support.



                 Johnson first thanked her daughter, Jamie Gomez, for her strength and the NCAI staff
           for their support, calling them family. She then thanked the influential women in her
           life, her mother and her late grandmother.



                 "I want to thank my grandmother whom I gather my strength from and who made me a
           resilient Tlingit woman," Johnson said. "I look over this audience of strong women today
           and I can see the same strength that my grandmother possessed.,,



                 Also honored at the luncheon was Gay Kingman-Wapato, the current Executive Director
           of the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association and a former executive director of NCAI.



                  "Today we honor Indian women who have made an impact not only on the local, regional
           and national levels, but also on the international levels," said luncheon host Julie
           Johnson.



                 Jacqueline Johnson has been the NCAI executive director since 2001. She is also the
           former chairperson of the National American Indian Housing Council and former Deputy

           Corporation and the Native American Advisory Council for Boys and Girls of America
           committees.
