            SP,

            For the Libraries Advisory Board I'm going to draft letters of re-appointment for those members . Previously, you
            didn't have a problem with the members, but you had wanted to appoint a school librarian from the Valley. I will
            let him know that he has to apply for nomination through the AK School Library Association and also let the
            association know to be expecting his name so they can send it forward for consideration next time around.
            If this is okay with you , I'll proceed.

            Also, for the next judge interviews I'll consolidate the questions onto one list instead of having three . It seems like
            it will make it easier.

            Thanks,
