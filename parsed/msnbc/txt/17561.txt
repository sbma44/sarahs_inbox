            Governor,

            Bitney came by this morning to talk about the fish boards. He thought Pnvileged or      eing appointed would settle a lot of
            the resentment in Homer right now. He said he would follow up with you.

              Alan stopped in today to sign the resignation letters . We can now move forward with sending nominations back
              east.

              North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission : Submit one nomination . We were considering P ri v il ege d      Because
              this appointment comes directly from the president it could take some time to get the new person appointed. Alan
              said it took two years before he was officially appointed . An acting board member selected from the Commission
              served until he was appointed.

              Bering Sea Fisheries U.S. Advisory Board: Submit two nominations. We were considering Privileged or Person,
              and Privileged or One has to be a preferred choice . Travel and lodging expenses for this board can 't be paid
              through the Office of the Governor . Earl Kreiger in ADF&G manages a federal grant that is used for travel to board
              meetings.

              Thanks,
