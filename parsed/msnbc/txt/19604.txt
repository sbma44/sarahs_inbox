               Former Gov. Wally Hickel was admitted to the hospital early this morning complaining of chest
               pain, according to Malcolm Roberts, his longtime aide.

               Hickel, 88, has been admitted to Providence Alaska Medical Center and will undergo
               testing all day, Roberts said.

               According to a press release from Nickel's office, he was feeling fine by 5 a.m. He asked
               for breakfast and told his staff to reschedule his meetings to Providence.

               The usually ebullient hotel and construction mogul was in good spirits today, wanting to
               return to work as soon as possible, Roberts said.

               Hickel was twice elected governor of Alaska, in 1966 and 1990.
