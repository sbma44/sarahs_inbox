                 Subject: Kuparuk Spill

               I just received notice that there was a spill reported at 3:00 PM today at Kuparuk. The 100 gallon of crude originally
               estimated was increased to 4,284 gallon (102 barrels). The cause appears to be external corrosion related. Cleanup is being
               hampered by 30 MPH winds and the spill area is covered with approx. 6 inches of snow. More detail is listed below but I
               will pass along additional information once I get it.

               INCIDENT NAME: Kuparuk 2U Pad Crude Oil Spill SITREP :7
               SPILL NUMBER: 07399935001 LEDGER CODE: 14247160
               TIME/DATE OF SPILL: ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. (CPAI) discovered the spill at 1:33 AM on December 16, 2007 and
               reported the spill to ADEC via the Alaska State Troopers at 2:43 AM.
               TIME/DATE OF SITUATION REPORT: 3:00 PM, January 2, 2008
               TIME/DATE OF THE NEXT REPORT: When final spill volume is determined
               TYPE/AMOUNT OF PRODUCT SPILLED: CPAI initially reported that over 100 gallons of crude oil, gas and fluids
               spilled from a 24-inch flow line located within the Kuparuk River field between the 2V and 2W pads. The initial estimate of
               over 100 gallons was increased to 4,284 gallons (102 barrels) after further assessment of the spill area. The spill area is
               tundra covered with approximately six inches of snow.
               LOCATION: Kuparuk River Field, flow line between 2U Pad and CPF-2. Latitude: N 70° 19' 19.99"
               Longitude: W149* 55' 41.52".
               CAUSE OF SPILL: CPAI reported external corrosion to the flow line. After the insulation from the flow line was removed,
               responders observed a 6-inch long crack (about 1/8 inch wide at the center) in the flow line. Investigators believe the cause
               was from external corrosion due to water trapped between the pipe and the insulation surrounding the flow line. Detailed
               investigation into the cause will be conducted.
               POTENTIAL RESPONSIBLE PARTY 'RPM: ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. (CPAI)
               RESPONSE ACTION: Weather is delaying cleanup operations today due to cold and 30 MPH winds.
               Thirty-four cleanup responders, split between two 12-hour shifts, supported by 20 Incident Command Team members are
               responding to the spill. On December 28th 2007, responders completed clean-up of wind-blown oil spray from the
               surrounding tundra and nearby frozen lake. The area has been sampled and the results are pending. Clean-up of the more
               heavily contaminated area near the point of release is continuing as weather allows. The majority of oil has been recovered.
               Responders are currently performing final cleanup with hand tools to remove a thin layer of oil that remains in this area.
               Contaminated snow is being processed in snow melters to separate waste types and determine oil volumes.
               Two ADEC spill responders are onsite monitoring the response and cleanup.
               SOURCE CONTROL: The source was controlled when operators shut down the oil wells feeding the flow lines.
