                  Subject: NGA/Resource Committee Priorities


                 Russ and I spoke today with representatives of Governor Schweizer , vice chair of the Natural Resources
                 Committee, and NGA staff concerning themes and priorities for the committee.

                 Subject to each of us obtaining guidance from our respective governors , we tentatively identified energy
                 Infrastructure as our major theme . In turn, this issue would be divided into the following components:

                      Natural gas and oil pipelines
                      Transmission lines
                      National electricity grid, including smart meters and storage
                      Funding of infrastructure, including public-private partnerships

                This theme extrapolates from the NGA chair's emphasis on infrastructure generally . In addition, Russ and I
                figured that it would be a good way to marshal additional bipartisan support for an Alaska gas pipeline to the
                lower 48.

                Before proceeding further, it would be helpful for us to know whether the foregoing makes sense to you.
                Thanks.
