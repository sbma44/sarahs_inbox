                 Subject : Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 18th, 2008
                 Dear All:

                 The Redeemer vessel began delivery this morning. During off-loading, winds picked up to gusts
                 of 50 to 70 mph. The vessel was using a loader as anchorage . The high winds pushed the vessel
                 offshore and pulled the loader into the water . The community is currently working to pull the
                 loader out during a -6 low tide. An estimated 1,000 gallons of #1 was offloaded before the
                 vessel disconnected . The vessel is returning to Dutch Harbor due to weather predictions
                 allowing no opportunities over the weekend . When weather allows, the vessel will return to
                 finish delivery. There is no evidence of any fuel loss. The fuel on hand will last until further
                 delivery.

                 A new update will follow Monday.

                 Karen Pletnikoff
