                           ...a bi-weekly update on U.S. Department of Education activities relevant to the
                                 Intergovernmental and Corporate community and other stakeholders




                 FY 2009 BUDGET

                 On February 4, President Bush released his Fiscal Year 2009 budget request, including $59.2 billion
                 in discretionary funding for the U.S. Department of Education. The request is the same as last
                 year's appropriation. However, within that total, the agency would receive sizable increases in
                 priority areas -- strengthening the No Child Left Behind Act, challenging high school students with
                 rigorous coursework, and making college more affordable -- by reducing funding in other areas,
                 eliminating 47 programs totaling $3.3 billion, and eliminating 759 earmarks totaling $328 million.
                 Among the highlights:

                 No Child Left Behind

                      a $406 million increase in Title I grants to states, to $14.3 billion (up 63% since 2001), to
                        increase high schools' share of Title I allocations;
                      a $607 million increase for Reading First, to $1 billion, to restore the funding required to
                        implement this effective program;
                      $491 million for School Improvement Grants, to support strong leadership in helping turning
                        around low-performing schools and school districts;
                      $409 million for Assessment Grants, including high school assessments aligned with college
                        and work-ready standards; and
                      $200 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund, to help develop modern compensation systems.

                      a $337 million increase in special education grants to states, to $11.3 billion, sustaining the federal
                        contribution at 17%;
                      $2.8 billion for Improving Teacher Quality state grants;
                      $730 million for English language acquisition;
                      $1.1 billion for new choice proposals : $300 million for Pell Grants for Kids, to supply scholarships
                        for low-income students enrolled in restructuring schools or high school "dropout factories" to
                        transfer to out-of-district public schools or local private schools, and $ 800 million for a revised 21st
                        Century Learning Opportunities program, to transform that low-performing initiative into a
                        scholarship program enabling poor students in struggling schools to enroll in high-quality afterschool
                        programs; and
                      $175 million for Academic Competitiveness Initiative proposals : $95 million for elementary and
                        middle school components of Math Now, which would employ research-based instruction in math
                        (based, in part, on the findings of the National Math Panel), $70 million for Advanced
                        Placement/International Baccalaureate expansion , and $10 million to create an Adjunct Teacher
                        Corps, which would encourage experienced professionals to teach high school courses.



                 Student Financial Aid

                      $18.9 billion in combined discretionary and mandatory funding for Pell Grants (up 116% since 2001),
                        to raise the maximum Pell Grant award to $4,800 (up 28% since 2001) and reach 5.8 million students
                        (up 33% since 2001).



                 The Department's discretionary appropriations have grown by $17 billion, or 40%, since FY 2001. FOR

                 AP REPORT

                 According to the College Board' s fourth annual "Advanced Placement Report to the Nation," 15.2% of the
                 graduating class of 2007 achieved mastery (at least a 3 on a 5-point scale) on one or more AP exams -- up
                 from 11 .7% for the 2002 class and 14.7% for the 2006 class. Moreover, six states now have more than 20%
                 of their students graduate from high school having earned an AP exam grade of 3 or higher. Nevertheless,
                 traditionally under-represented students still demonstrate much lower performance on AP exams . Indeed,
                 although some states have successfully closed the gap for Hispanic students , no state with significant
                 numbers of African-American or American Indian students has closed the gap . The report also spotlights
                 states' efforts to implement programs that support academic achievement for all students . FOR MORE

                  headquarters for 23 of the Fortune 500 companies ," she said. "So, I know you agree that instead of
                 debating whether it's responsible to teach the fundamentals of reading and math we should be talking about
                 how to prepare every student for college and today's global economy. That's why, two years ago, I launched
                 a commission to start a national conversation on access , affordability, and accountability in higher
                 education," led by a Houston businessman, Charles Miller. And, she continued, in "reaction" to the
                 commission's report, "We're seeing some very encouraging things . A coalition of institutions began sharing
                 information that has never before been publicly available.... Texas is using the accrediting process to
                 increase access and innovation in higher education . Ivy League universities have increased aid to students.
                 More consumers axe talking in terms of quality, affordability, and return for investment." Then, on
                 February 12, she delivered the keynote at the National Legislative Summit of the American Association of
                 Community Colleges and the Association of Community College Trustees
                 (http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases /`2008/02/02122008.html). "Community colleges have never...
                 rationed opportunity towards the privileged," she said. "Instead of keeping people out, you invite them in
                 to higher education -- and not just for degrees but for targeted workforce training. Your efforts must serve
                 as a model because... shifting demographics and the rise of the global knowledge economy mean that we
                 must educate more students to higher levels than ever before." Notably, President Bush appointed the first
                 Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Colleges, Pat Stanley, and Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary
                 Education Diane Jones began her career as a community college teacher. Clearly, "We need better ways to
                 follow students as they move across the system," she concluded, citing some budget items to assist. "Not
                 just first-time, full-time, degree-seeking, non-transfer students -- but all students." FOR MORE

                At both venues, the Secretary lamented a House bill reauthorizing the Higher Education Act for failing to
                tackle the "real concerns of students and families ." The White House has issued a detailed Statement of
                Administration Policy on the legislation. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

                 "The budget process is one where we must balance process and priorities , and I believe this budget does
                 that for education. In addition to Reading First [being fully restored ], I am pleased the budget calls for
                 increased funding for Title I, IDEA, and Pell Grants . All of these programs are essential to ensuring that,
                 our children not only have access to a rigorous education, but one suited for the global economy. I hope
                 Congress acts to fund these important programs at the level requested by the President."

                 Dear Friends,

                Founders Education Fund, a project of the EPACT Education Fund, in co-sponsorship with
                FreedomArts'presents the following video broadcasts in honor of Presidents Day. These videos
                can be seen over the public access TV channels 27 and 28, originating out of the Mid-Peninsula
                Community Media Center (generally referred to as The Media Center) serving the following
                communities on the San Francisco Mid-Peninsula: Atherton, East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Palo
                Alto, Stanford, and unincorporated parts of San Mateo County in the vicinity of Redwood City.

                In the past, these videos in honor of Presidents Day could only be seen by those living on the San
                Francisco Mid-Peninsula. Thanks to Internet streaming, these videos can now be seen anywhere
                in the world. To view these videos over the Internet on your computer, go to the following
                website: http://www.communitymediacenter.net. To the right of the word WATCH, pull down
                the navigate menu. Select "Webcasts." Or click on the button "Check Schedules and
                Webcasts." Then click on the link "program schedule." In the Search box you can type "George
                Washington" and find the broadcast schedule. The webcasts for each channel are located on the
                right-hand side of the screen.

                For your convenience, I am listing the schedule for the Presidents Day celebration below:

                 Descriptive notes for each of these programs may be found at the Founders Education Fund temporary
                 website (http://www.stanford.edu/-wbw/founders.htm) as well as other documents and information
                 relating to programs on the Founding years of the United States of America.

                 Announcements about cultural and educational programs produced by Founders Education
                 Fund in co-sponsorship with FreedomArts are typically sent each year around Presidents' Day
                 in February and Independence Day in late June shortly before the Fourth of July and in early
                 December to commemorate the anniversary of Washington 's passing . The announcements are
                 currently sent to individuals and organizations on three continents . The website makes
                 available information that complements the broadcast programs . Through the website we
                 hope eventually to make available the entire content of the broadcast programs.

                 If you would like to change your email address or unsubscribe from receiving future Founders
                 Education Fund program announcements , please send a reply and we will either remove or
