                 Supreme Court Jurisdiction

                The term "jurisdiction" means a court's legal power and authority to hear particular types of cases.

                The supreme court has final state appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters:

                  1. CIVIL APPEALS: The supreme court must accept appeals from final decisions by the superior
                     court in civil cases (including cases which originated in administrative agencies).
                  2. The supreme court may exercise its discretion to accept:
                      a. CRIMINAL APPEALS, from decisions of the court of appeals or upon certification from the
                      court of appeals that the case involves a significant question of constitutional law or an issue of
                      substantial public interest; and

                        b. PETITIONS, from non-final decisions by the superior court in civil cases and from final
                        decisions of the superior court on review of the district court's decisions in civil matters.

                  3. ORIGINAL APPLICATIONS: The supreme court may also exercise its discretion to hear matters
                     in which relief is not otherwise available, including bar admission and attorney discipline matters
                     and questions of state law certified from the federal courts.
