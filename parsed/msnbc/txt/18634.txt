         I had Cora give a run down on what is happening with the Climate Change sub-cabinet. See
         below.



         I just spoke with Larry and got a little more information on a few topics.

         The administrative order creating the climate change sub-cabinet is ready for the
         Governor's signature.  She will likely be signing it Friday when she is in town. It may
         be appropriate to issue a press release.

        The climate change sub-cabinet is meeting in Fairbanks in early October. It is likely
        that at that meeting they will recommend that representatives from DEC be appointed
        observers to the Western Region Climate Initiative.  Mike Tibbles already has a draft
        letter to that effect. As observers, we can participate in the process, but aren't
        necessarily agreeing to the goals they have adopted. Again, when this is finalized, we
        could issue a press release.

        It appears that most of the suggested actions are already in the works.

           Subject: Climate Change



          The administration has been fairly active on climate change, although groups highly
          focused on the issue might desire even more action or might be unaware of some of our
          efforts.



          * The Governor created the climate change sub-cabinet, which has been meeting regularly
          and coordinating between departments, the Governor's office, and the university on the
          issue.  The sub-cabinet received a fair amount of press coverage when it was first created
          despite the lack of a formal announcement. If we were to finalize the administrative
          order creating the sub-cabinet, that might be an opportunity for a press release to again
          draw attention to these efforts. The sub-cabinet has been working with communities,
          national groups, the legislative commission, and the congressional delegation to address
          topics such as effects on fisheries, erosion in coastal communities, federal legislation,
          and carbon emissions.

          * At some point, federal funding may be available to help states adapt         and cope with the
          effects of climate change.  Our D.C. office is already working closely         with our
          congressional delegation on legislation.  At this point it isn't clear         whether such
          legislation will be passed or what form it may take, but our office is         working to ensure
          that Alaska benefits from any such legislation.

         * We have not yet spoken publicly on HB152, the renewable energy fund. This is largely
         due to uncertainty about the funding source. Although the concept is one that we would
         likely support, it is important to verify that the funding source. Options, including the
         possible use of remaining railbelt energy funds, are being explored. Once a concrete
         proposal for funding has been advanced, we will be in a position to determine and announce
         our support for the fund.

          * The benefits of the gas pipeline to both the state and the nation have been a major
          focus of communications from this office. It is possible that a specific tie to climate
          change could be further emphasized in the future.

         * The Western Region Climate Initiative is a relatively new group, formed in February of
         this year.  Currently 6 states and 2 Canadian provinces have joined, while another 4
         states and 3 provinces are observers. The climate change sub-cabinet has been discussing
         what the appropriate level of involvement for Alaska in this and other such initiatives
         might be.

         * We are also coordinating with the Arctic Research Commission to identify opportunities
         for state involvement in research and policy matters in the Arctic as changing conditions
         draw increased global attention to this area.



         I can follow up with Larry about progress and future plans for the climate change sub-
         cabinet and provide more information after I have the opportunity to talk with him.

         Governor , I thought a lot about whether I should pass this on but decided you would want
         to see what the conservation side is thinking . I don ' t agree with all the comments but a
         lot matches our thoughts and I respect Kate. Tom
