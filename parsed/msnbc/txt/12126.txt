              Governor,



              I am happy to forward you some ANSCA-oriented bullets to use for your call-in to the Board
              meeting at 2:00 tomorrow (800-369-0860, code 130047#)·   Today is extremely nutty for us
              all, so I won't get to it before tonight (don't tell my wife I am working on this on V's
              Day evening!).  So unless I hear back from you to the contrary, I will simply plan on
              pulling something (simple) together and shooting it your way for you tonight.   Tom and I
              will be getting together late this afternoon to plan our talk.



              Bruce




              PS, just finished war-gaming with Marty/Kurt for Fagan. I sold my soul and played Fagan
              (of course to make for true debate prep, I conjured an intelligent Fagan). They are
              READY.
