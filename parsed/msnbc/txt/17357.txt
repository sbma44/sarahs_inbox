           Andy wrote to the general governor account and his message was forwarded to me.

           Governor Palin,

           I would like to thank you for the interested expressed by your office concerning my
           possible availability to serve on the Alaska Board of Fisheries.   As I
           mentioned to Ivy
           over the phone, this is not a good time for me to take up such a demanding
           position, but I was honored to be conisdered as a possible candidate, and a year or
           two in the future may be willing to put my hat in the ring for consideration.

           Thank You for your consideration,

           Andy Couch
