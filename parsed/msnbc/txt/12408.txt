              Governor,



               I will call Chuck Hamel and listen to his concerns. He might be interested in knowing
              that we plan to go out with the RFP in a few weeks to hire the contractor for the first
              phase of the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Risk Assessment . The public, including Mr. Hamel,
              will have the opportunity to provide input on what facilities, operations and practices
              should be examined as part of the risk assessment.



               I am in Washington, D.C., flying back to Anchorage on Thursday. I could probably meet
              with Hamel in person late Wednesday afternoon, after my 3:00 p.m. meeting with John Katz.



               Thanks,

               Larry

               It was a good mtg. He ' s fine about psio funding and is wanting to assist me. He's very
              frustrated tho that he believe BP snookers psio into believing they've got it all under
              control - and slhe still cant believe psio let up on GC 1 fire investigation.



               And Larry - i promised Hamel you ' d call him . He at least wants a quiuck convo on a couple
              of issues that he , again , believes we're getting snookered on. Pls call him. Thanks

              Governor,



              Unfortunately , the Hamel letter is a pdf , and cannot be pasted . Hamel is in DC, as far
             as I know . Jonne will be in the office in 30 mins , and will provide a more detailed
             report to this group then , including a summary of the Hamel letter.



              In short, the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation ( given its
             staffing limitations ),. and pushing BP very hard . PSIO has completed a thorough technical
             review that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak,
             and the final section of the report , an addendum addressing materials traceability, will
             be completed in the next day or two .   We'll send it to Mr . Bewak directly and post it on
             the PSIO website.



              As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
             info, you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr. Hamel ( I assumed that's why you
             asked where he is)

            Energy Committee.



             I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



             P.S.

             Governor , in a voice mail message, Mr. Hamel expressed his desire             to meet with you during
