             Governor-

             I have been asked about a baby shower in Juneau. I have already received offers to host
             it.  Please let me know if you would be interested in a similair event.



             I too think the idea of helping young Army wives is fantastic.

            Yes, I'll give him a call initially and then have someone work with him on details. Love
            the idea about the young army wives.

                  Wants KWHL to throw me a baby shower. I say "yes", if the gifts can go to these
            young Army wives who don't have much, they're far from their families, the dads aren't
            there for the newborns first months, etc. And now Ft. Wainwright's aviation unit was
            notified of a four month extension on deployments. Would u assign someone to work with Bob
            on that angle? Thanks
