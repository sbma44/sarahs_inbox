     I
            Thanks Tom, I agree completely with the sentiment. This is a big deal.

            for Alaska, and we need to make sure we launch it correctly. Our

            strength has always been our candid internal discussions; challenging

            each other to make what's good even better.

            I'm also coming in late to this exchange, but would like to add a little

            bit...

           I am late getting into this discussion but some thoughts for the friends

           I am absolutely proud to be with. I think the collective we are doing

           great.     We have been through a really tough time and all of us have been

           personally attacked for doing what is right. That is stressful. Seems

           like this has taken an eternity, yet we are soooo close to the goal.



           I have had the opportunity to hear and be part of the proposal being

           developed for Monday     Privileged or Person     Our success has been to

           question, argue and harden ourselves for the next round of questions.

           Let's keep it up. Better in house than out house.



           I hope you have a special July 4th. As we celebrate our country's

           freedom, I think in our own way we are now fighting for our state's

           freedom.    God bless you all. Tom

          Ok, got it. I appreciate your take on this and I sincerely appreciate

          all your hard work on this, and AGIA. It was interesting to watch

          Stevens the other day though in our presser as he rolled out his "energy

          plan" with caveats left and right explaining these were " ideas,

          proposals.-. needed to be fleshed out in DC, etc," obviously having

          learned not to get himself in a box with some solid PLAN that he'd later

          perhaps have to amend . We've rolled out things/timelines before that we

          later had to amend, so with this Enstar plan I'd like              Privileged or Persona

          Sorry, I'm just a little on-edge after the past couple of days. This

          whole gasline episode has been a long and exhausting ordeal.

          Governor, Kris,



          Here is what I believe to be the "final " concept paper for the "In-State

          Gas" Conference on Monday .      This paper has the blessing of both ANGDA

          and ENSTAR and this is the concept we are all working off. And,

          hopefully , their comments will be pegged off it as well. The following

          people will be at the press event , although other representatives from

          the entities may show-up:




          ENSTAR:



          Gene Dubay , Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems (owner

          company of ENSTAR)




          Colleen Starring , Regional VP for ENSTAR




          ANGDA:




          Scott Heyworth , Acting Chairman

          Joe Balash, Gov's Ofc



          Marcia Davis, DOR



          Marty Rutherford, DNR




          I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for

          1:00pm on Monday , July 7th,     in your Anchorage Conference Room. They

          have also been advised that you will be announcing this formation of a

          project development venture (a public/private partnership) and will be

          laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and

          Harold Heinze making brief statements. I have asked everyone to be at

          your offices about 15 minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into

          the Conference Room together.




          I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you,

          Governor.. Should you wish anything else, please let me know. My cell

          phone #: 317-4728.

          Also, we have identified a series of people to pre-message this

           announcement to and we will be making those calls on Sunday evening and

           early Monday.




           Thanks for all your support, Governor, and for your recognition that

           dealing with in-state gas needs is critical!       It was a great insight

           that I believe will push the AGIA License over the edge!



           Marty
