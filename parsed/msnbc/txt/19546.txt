                 Subject: NPRA Record of Decision/Fall Lease Sale


                There are no surprises in this announcement, but the final Record of Decision does set the stage for a major
                lease sale by the BLM this fall.

                While perhaps coincidental , the BLM announcement occurs at a time when the Democratic leadership in the
                House is seeking to feature NPR -A as an essential element of its energy policy (announced last week). Critics
                counter that. the BLM is already doing everything possible to lease acreage in NPR -A on an expeditious basis.

                       Record of Decision Sets Stage for Major Lease Sale in National Petroleum
                                           Reserve Alaska

                   In a Record of Decision issued today, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
                   announced that it will make land available for oil and gas leasing in the
                   northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A).

                   "This action sets the stage for a major lease sale this fall. This is
                   welcome news at a time when Americans are paying record prices at the
                   pump," said C. Stephen Allred, Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals,
                   in signing the ROD.

                   At the same lease sale, the BLM also plans to offer land in the northwest
                   portion of the NPR-A.

                   worldwide imbalance in energy supply and demand ," Secretary of the
                   Interior Dirk Kempthome said. "Developing the NPR -A in an
                   environmentally sound manner will contribute to our domestic oil and
                   natural gas supplies. Together with new production from other offshore
                   and onshore areas, these increased supplies will help stabilize energy
                   costs."

                   The lands made available for leasing under plans for NPR-A northeast and
                   northwest could result in a much as 8.4 billion barrels of oil being
                   developed. The lands could also provide trillions of cubic feet of
                   natural gas for shipment to North American markets through gas pipelines
                   currently in the planning stages.

                   'This decision provides for the protection of high value wildlife,
                   including waterfowl and caribou , and meets the subsistence needs of North
                   Slope residents while making lands with oil and gas potential available
                   for leasing," said BLM Alaska State Director Tom Lonnie.

                   The plan includes protections for the polar bear , including requirements
                   to consider impacts on areas used by polar bears for denning.
                   Additionally, with the listing of the polar bear the agency will continue
                   to work closely with the U .S. Fish and Wildlife Service on future oil and
                   gas activities.

                   According to the Record of Decision , the BLM defers leasing for 10 years
                   on land currently unavailable for leasing north and east of Teshekpuk
                   Lake.

                   The BLM, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, manages more
                   land - 258 million surface acres than any other Federal agency . Most of
                   this public land is in 12 Western states, including 80.8 million surface
                   acres in Alaska . The Bureau also administers 700 million acres of
                   sub-surface mineral estate throughout the nation. The BLM 's multiple-use
                   mission is to sustain the health and productivity of the public lands for
                   the use and enjoyment of present and future generations . The Bureau
                   accomplishes this by managing such activities as outdoor recreation,
                   livestock grazing , mineral development, and energy production, and by
                   conserving natural, historical, cultural, and other resources on the
                   public lands.
