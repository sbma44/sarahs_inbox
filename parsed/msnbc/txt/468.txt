Let me know if the First Family is invited to any Juneau events this summer and we can get the kids
back - otherwise I'll plan on them being in SouthCentral. We're headed to airport - Piper's with me, I'll
bring Agia with me next time - she can hang out at the house and I asked Ivy to check on her at
night.



Also - I do need to know when the mansion work will take place so I can finalize summer schedules
around that.



Thanks! Hopefully there will be a few First Family events for Piper and Willow, at least, to participate
in in Juneau. With enough notice I can get them back here.
