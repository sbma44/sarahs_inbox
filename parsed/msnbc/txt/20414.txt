              Governor, I've contacted the Armed Services YMCA, Army Community Service at Ft Rich, DMVA (only
              via e-mail - no one answered any pf their phones) and Pete Mulcahy, formerly of Armed Services YMCA
              - and he's going to blast e-mail it out to all of his many , many contacts in town.

               I am happy to staff you for this event unless you already have someone else in mind.

           I sent it in the middle of the night, don't know what happened on blackberry clock though.

              Yes, pls correct ADN that Frank was never manager , and custody battle should be past
           tense.

                 And try for the correction on the edited/spliced "Frank tape" they played on Channel
           11.

          Governor,



          The timing on.this message, which we have not seen before, is confusing.
    1     It looks as though it was sent at 3:28 p.m. today, which of course is

          impossible. So anyway, no, no corrections have been made because we're

          just seeing this.



          We certainly can let Kyle know about his misidentification of Frank's

          role in the campaign.     Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

          It may drive me crazy trying to catch all the corrections we'll be

          reading and seeing in the media, but please help me catch them and ask

          for the corrections.

           * Today's ADN: Bailey was never my campaign manager . Please correct.

            * Today's AP: Piper is 7, not 8.

            * There needs , also , clarification in a general press statement that

          reminds Alaskans that it is not only appropriate but even directed by

          DoL's website that " complaints (or concerns ) about a trooper ARE TO BE

          brought forth to the DPS Commissioner's Office". (Why have they reported

          so erroneously on that fact - like there was something wrong with anyone

           doing what Law directs concerned individuals to do?!)

               There are too many Channel 11 corrections to even list here, but

           please ask them why they spliced Bailey ' s tape and edited it the way

           they did without disclosing that.

               Pls let me know when these correction requests are forwarded today...

           and I still think we need a strong press statement that clarifies the

           general misunderstanding of "PRESSURING-Monegan" calls. These

           appropriate inquiries were not pressure.

               And that my sister wasn't in the midst of a divorce, that ' s been over

           for a few years . And even the custody battle is past tense . They keep

           reporting that incorrectly also.
