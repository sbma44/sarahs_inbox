                 Governor,

                 Is there anything you need or anything Karen or I can do today? Sean emailed me about Privileged or and Russ
                 had a few edits. Should I incorporate those into a new document and send you a revise version.

                 Also, we are going to send the charts out to the cabinet in a little while so they know what to expect tomorrow.

                 Mike

                   Subject : Railbelt Electrical Grid Authority Study - Request for Stakeholder Input


                  To REGA Stakeholders:

                  First, the Black & Veatch project team' appreciates your involvement in last week's REGA Technical
                  Conference. We found the discussion and information provided very useful in better understanding the
                  underlying issues and conditions that need to be addressed in the REGA assessment.

                  As I mentioned during my comments, it is very important for us to obtain input from all stakeholders. To
                  that end, we offer the following three opportunities for everyone to provide us with additional information:

                              o We have prepared the following file to provide an opportunity for you to respond to specific
                                questions as well as to provide any additional comments. We ask that you review this file
                                and provide us with any comments by December 31st . Please send your comments
                                directly to me at the e-mail address above.

                                               <<Stakeholder Input Form.doc>>

                              o Second, we ask you to send us any reference documents that you believe we should
                                 consider during the course of the project. Again, please send these documents directly
                                 to me electronically, or send hard copies to me at the address below , by December
                                 31st.
                              o We also offer the opportunity for you to meet with Black & Veatch project team members
                                 in Anchorage, at the AEA offices (813 W. Northern Lights Boulevard), on the following
                                dates:
                                           s Tuesday, 1/8
                                           s Wednesday, 1/9
                                           s Thursday, 1/10
                                           s Tuesday, 1/22
                                           s Wednesday, 1/23
                                           s Thursday, 1/24

                                If you are interested in meeting with us, please contact Sherrie Siverson , AEA/AIDEA
                                Administrative Assistant , at 907-269-4693. She will schedule a time.

                                For those not located in Anchorage , and who can not make it easily to Anchorage, we will
                                also set up times to meet at other locations. This schedule will be developed in concert with
                                meetings (which have yet to be set up) with the REGA Advisory Group at certain locations
                                throughout the Railbelt. If you would like to meet at another location, please call Sherrie
                                and let her know your desire. We will try to set up meetings in person or, alternatively, we
                                will set up times to hold discussions on the telephone.




                 Please feel free to give me a call at (425) 427-1652 if you have any questions.

                  I won't be near a pc to make any more edits on my speech after circulating it last night... I'm booked from my
                  commute in, to this morning's speech, to filming a PSA... so someone else will have to figure out how to make adds
                  edits before the press event - thank you.

                  Mike,
                   Sorry I missed your call today. I just picked up messages tonight and left you a message on your cell. I think the
                  governor's draft remarks are generally pretty good but I have a few suggested changes:

                  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                  That's all I have. Looks like good work so far. Thanks.

                  Sean
