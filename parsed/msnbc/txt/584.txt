Walt- we'll ask you to chime in on Gara's proposal re: the gun issue in today's ADN when we all can
sit down to discuss the issue.



The first thought that hit me when reading Gara's quote about people not being able to buy guns
when they're threatening to kill someone went to my ex brother-in-law, the trooper, who threatened to
kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this day carries a gun, of course.
We can't have double standards. Remember when that death threat was reported, and follow-on
threats from Mike that he was going to "bring Sarah and her family down" - instead of any reprimand
WE were told by trooper union personnel that we'd be sued if we talked about those threats.
Amazing. And he's still a trooper, and he still carries a gun, and he still tells anyone who will listen
that he will "never work for that b*itch" (me) because he has such anger and distain towards my
family.



So consistency is needed here. No one's above the law. If the law needs to be changed to not allow
access to guns for people threatening to kill someone, it must apply to everyone.



Hopefully we'll all meet on this soon, as Gara will be expecting a response soon.
