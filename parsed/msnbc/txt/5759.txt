            I didn't know about it. You would think he would have to ask permission to use your name/pic on anything he's
            sending out. If you need me to follow up with the Party I will, but will wait incase somebody is already handling it.

            In other news, you might already know... Katie Hurley beat Dallas Massie in the MEA race. Don and Sharon
            called me right afterwards...

            Happy birthday to my favorite 6 year old!!
