             Thank you!    And I would say this is due to the great work of the DC Office personnel.

            -Subject: Anti-Alaska Riders




             I am pleased to report that none of the anti-Alaska policy riders = described below and in
             my memorandum of October 9th has apparently been = included in the omnibus appropriations
             bill currently under considerat = ion by Congress.

                                                                 1

              I would like to say that the absence of these riders is due to the = efforts of your DC
              office.  Hopefully, our advocacy was a = factor.  However, full disclosure compels me to
              say that the biggest = factors were the anti-rider stance of the Bush administration and
              the = procedural situation in Congress which made it difficult to include riders = in the
              omnibus bill.



              The riders (or threats of riders) would have -



              * Required that Alaska return federal highway funds for the Gravina = Island and Knik Arm
              Bridges=20

              * Restricted oil and gas leasing in NPR-A and North Aleutian Basin=20

              * Prohibited the use of federal funds to build new roads in the = roadless areas of the
              Tongass National Forest, thereby sharply restricting = timber harvest. =20

              * Restricted Alaska's wolf management program=20

              * Limited claims of access under RS2477=20

              * Prohibited the importation of polar bear parts from Canada, = thereby jeopardizing polar
              bear management in Northern Canada.



              Other anti-Alaska initiatives, such as additional wilderness in the = Tongass and the
              Coastal Plain of ANWR, never came up in the appropriations = process .  However, with a new
              President and Congress, we can = expect these to reemerge in the future.



             P.S.

              In a later spreadsheet , we will report on the fate of the State's = various appropriations
              requests and also other funding for Alaska.




             Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
             <mailto:jwkatzoalaskadc.org> jwkatzoalaskadc.org. = Thank you .
