                  This is mine . Today I talked to Chris Mello at AIEDANAEA. He is going to work on some ideas to help them. It is
                  a difficult situation since you don't want to put in temporary type fuel pipes. Then once the fuel is there , they need
                  a place to store it. He said he would get to me by the end of the week.

                  We should respond to this... would like some thoughts.

                  Thanks.

                  Hello Meghan, Sharon,

                  Rachel D'Oro here with The Associated Press, Anchorage bureau. I'm
                  working on a story that's moving Thursday and I hope one of you can help
                  me. I was working with Charles Fedulo on it but now I hear he's no
                  longer with the governor's office.
                  Here's the story: erosion has made Newtok's closest river so
                  shallow that barges can no longer make regular fuel deliveries there.
                  Fuel to operate the village power plant is being flown in, but others

                 can't afford the costly alternative.
                 So residents are looking for help to build some kind of pipeline
                 system to transport fuel delivered by barges from the next nearest
                 river. But complicating that effort, state and federal funds have dried
                 up because Newtok has begun to relocate from its increasingly battered
                 site to higher ground nine miles to the south.
                 I would like to hear the governor's thoughts on what is now a
                 unique predicament, a village in limbo with no funding at the old site,
                 but still far from completing its move. Newtok could be just the
                 beginning and could set a precedent on how government deals with similar
                 cases in the future.
                 Thanks for any insight you can share.
                 Regards,
                 Rachel D'Oro
