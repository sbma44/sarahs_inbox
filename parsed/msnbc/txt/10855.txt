            Absolutely ridiculous poilcy. Can't believe I never heard of it until it was a done deal.
            I've heard nothing but huge complaints about this and everyone I've spoken with is ready
            to just turn in their state equipment and exclusively use personal cells.

            Could u do that for me - cut and paste. I'm calling Canadian officals for the next hours.



            The policy is ridiculous and I'm disappointed anyone assumed the admin was all on board
            with it. I just don't have time to fix it - but her interpretation of IRS rules is odd on
            this one and I disagree with it.
