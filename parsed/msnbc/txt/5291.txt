                  Sent:     Friday, February 23, 2007 11:45 AM
                  To:       Sarah Palin; govpalin@gov.state.ak.us; 'Michael Tibbles'
                  Subject: Permanent Fund Corporation

                Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles,

                I received a call from the Corporation and also from Commissioner Galvin regarding the upcoming meeting (next
                Wed and Thurs). Galvin, as Commissioner of Revenue, is required by statute to serve on the board. Another
                seat should be filled by a "head of a principal department of the governor's designation.' In the past the
                Commissioner of DNR, Commerce or the AG has served as the designee. Galvin recommends Irwin, Colberg or
                Notti.

                I can let the Corporation know which commissioner will serve if either of you can respond back via email or phone
                with a name.

                Hope all is well back east!
