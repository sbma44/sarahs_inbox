          Subject: Email




          Kopp's dispatcher sent me an email nearly two weeks ago- it was forwarded to other depts
          but was never forwarded to me. I had to ask for it, had to track down the accuser's name,
          and had to follow up in the search for this significant piece of communication. In
          addition, many other emails pertaining to "Kopp/Sexual Harassment" were evidently sent
          over the past week, but not one was forwarded to me. This is not good- it should be common
          sense to forward these to me, especially the one from the former dispatcher involved in
          Kopp's accusations (esp with her claim in the email that she has her file of evidence and
          had wanted me to see it).

            As I have been requesting, this communication system must change. A significant email
          such as the one mentioned here that was forwarded to Boards and Commissions, special
          assistants, plus other areas should have been forwarded to me and or Talis and Nizich. If
          it was a receptionist in the receiving departments who did not know how important this was
          (perhaps she does not read the paper?) then please work with your receptionists/admin asst
          folks to instruct them on this type of issue. It really can not happen again.

            I know we get a ton of emails, but these of the Kopp/sexual harassment nature should
          have obviously been flagged though and not buried in any communication file somewhere.
          Thank you

              Subject: AOC Board recommendation on upcoming ADF&G Deputy Commissioner position
              Dear Governor, Chief of Staff, and ADF&G Commissioner.

              The Alaska Outdoor Council Board of Directors at its 7/23/08 meeting, unanimously approved a
              motion to recommend Tina Cunning for the ADF&G Deputy Commissioner position to be
              vacated soon by Ken Taylor.

              I will forward the AOC's letter on the subject in the next couple days, but I wanted to promptly
              apprise you of the AOC Board's recommendation.

              Alaska Outdoor Council
