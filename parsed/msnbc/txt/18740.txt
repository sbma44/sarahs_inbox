          I will ask him for an overall progress report. The work on the Unified System Operator
          study will largely be done by a contractor. I know the RPF was issued last week. We are
          meeting with AIDEA today (10:00 am) to go over their budget and I will ask for a work plan
          with timelines.



          Mike

         him in almost a year), esp status report on $ 800g energy study that's now going on two-
         years being behind . Have him send me that aspect of a progress report today, it shouldnt
         take him long to jot an email letting me know what he's done to get the utilities to work
         together and present that study so I don't have to veto the railbelt energy funds again.
         Thanks
