          Hello everyone... pardon me for this late entry. I see that there were some emails I
          wasn't included in and so perhaps this next question was already addressed: Privileged            or Persaf
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           Thanks for everyone's flexibility and quick set-up - and a Copper River King, too!



           Thanks,

           Meg

           My recommendation is that we invite Privileged or Personal Material   Redacted                      My
          rough count is 22 ppl. We could do it onig at              or .

            Tonight's great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and
          still be successful. There's a Costco in Juneau, if you know what I mean. And my family is
          quite capable of setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

            Great idea!  Please all decide what is best for AGIA. But if time doesn't matter
          tonight is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.
          Again decide what is best for AGIA. Tom

              Cool! We should cook it for whomever needs to have that get-together / reception
           opportunity tonight, tomorrow, or wednesday . I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good
           opportunity to have folks over for informal gasline chat.
