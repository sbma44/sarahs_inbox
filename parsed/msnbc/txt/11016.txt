              I called Portia on it--radio silence so far.



              Quinn just so happens to have a phone interview with Lyda this morning and plans on asking
              who provided the "verbal invitation" because neither the governor,her employees, or
              friends received any kind of invitation.



              Let him know Portia should be answering some of these questions too...he said he'd fill me
              in after the interview.

             Alrighty....just got off line with Lyda. She has plenty of gray area, saying she "was
             told by one of the guys who co-hosted the event that he 'told all of them to come on
             over'.". She then said, "it was not by me, I didn't invite her.". When I asked her to
             recall which co-host, she thought about it a bit and said she really couldn't remember.



              I said , " oh so the Gov wasn't individually invited?". She said "I think they just said
              ' you guys come on over,".

              Very vague .... and I thought there was only one co-host? Why's she saying she can't
              remember?



              I'm not sure here , but I'll get with Sharon and imatbe we can get mainstream media to do a
              little contrast.



              At very least I know Eddie Burke will pick up on it.

               Will do. Also in response to the emails about Lyda, I too think she should be called out
              on this. Her dishonesty shouldn't go unchecked... it'll be interesting what Frank
              discovers.

              streamlined agencies , etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
              understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

                  I'm submitting a letter- they won't let me do a compass so soon after my polar bear one. Someone else should use
                  your piece, or maybe they'd let you-do so, so the public may better understand.

                  Ok, if you're submitting a Compass piece. ..no need to go farther . They'll only print one response from us so no need
                  to go to Karen or for me to send. Feel free to take sentences or paragraphs from this . I wont send unless you move
                  on to other things and don't do.
