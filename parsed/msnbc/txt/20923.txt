          J- i feel obligated to that coach to "coach" his team, as we already committed to it and
          it helped justify my trip back down to Juneau this week. I hate to back out unless there's
          absolutely no other way.




          Is security going, if so -who?

         Governor -




         Since we need to get you to New York on Sunday, 10.07. We need to get you back from
         Juneau on Saturday, 10.06 either the 7:20 a.m. - 9:06 a.m. flight or the 1:46 p.m. - 3:32
         p.m. flights (both are none stops JNU/ANC). We can have the family tour the HUB Christian
         Center on Friday afternoon as this was a family invitation. We would not have you attend
         the football game that evening - you will be hosting dinner for them the night before.




         Sunday - Northwest seems to be the best for pricing @ approx. $577.10 w/taxes included.
         Early a.m. departure 9:00 a.m. thru MN arriving New York, LGA @ 10:55 p.m. 9Hr/55 min.
         duration (4 hour time difference from AK). New York, Monday, 10.08 - departure on
         Thursday, 10.11.07 @ 1:29 p.m. thru MN arriving ANC @ 8:09 p.m. 10hr/40 min. duration.
         Of course there are other flight time/options. These seem to be the best price with the
         shortest time durations.
