              Folks , I am sending this note to let you know that the APOC approved at its commission
              meeting last week a referral of lobbyist Ashley Reed to this office for consideration of
              criminal prosecution .   ( I just learned this today , by the way .) Apparently he has a 21
              year history of late and incomplete reporting under the lobbyist registration and
              reporting requirements .   Patty Ware , staff at APOC , is putting together a report which
              will be provided to the AG .   However , she is not ready to send it yet and thinks it may
              take her a few weeks .   I am giving you this forewarning because the commissioners acted in
              an open meeting . Because the request for the, referral was made in public meeting, there
              may be press interest.
