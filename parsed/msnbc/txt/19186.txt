         Tom Wright is the legislative staffer. I don't know for sure who his source is, but he
         said its somebody up there now.

        Who?



        See, it will be important to know the legitimacy of this rumor so our overseeing agency
        can be properly prepared.

        It was third-hand.  A former staffer with a buddy on the Slope told me. His contact is
        somebody at BP that's up there. . .and the BP person learned of it this afternoon.

          Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
          fixes...

          with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
          than 100 people . An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
          informed.  The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
          winter work . Sorry I don't have more details , but this was passed on to me third-hand
          just a few minutes ago.
