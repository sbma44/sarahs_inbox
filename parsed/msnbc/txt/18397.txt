         I called Sean. He didn't know about it but said he would like to. He is about 10 minutes
         away from the office and will go to the conf call location... which I'll need to get from
         Mike.

          Mike and Tom are scheduled at 9am to conference with Mark M. Can you be conferenced in
          via your cell phone or would you like to have a separate call later?
