                Brown Shirts : Current 96 positions authorized: 87 are working, and 9
                positions are being recruited. For the upcoming leg cycle, the dept has
                asked for 3 more AWT trooper positions, the long term strategic goal is
                to reach 120 AWT troopers which would restore the Division to the 1985
                timeframe level.

                Labor : 2007 unemployment rate: 6.1 percent (or an employment rate of
                96.9%). 6.7 percent in 2006. Forecast for 2008 is 2,000 jobs / 0.6% (down
                from 3,500 in 2007, 1.1%). For 20 consecutive years Alaska's job count
                has grown.   It's the longest uninterrupted stretch of growth since
                statehood and one that only seven other states can match. 2007 was a
                strong year for the oil and gas industry, which added 1,200 annualized
                jobs.

                Suicide : Alaska has consistently ranked either #1 or #2 in the nation
                with our suicide rate. Last available nationwide data ranked us top at
                23.6%.

                If you'd like me to send a word document so it is easier to cut and
                paste, I'll do that.
