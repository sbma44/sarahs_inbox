           How can they leave AGIA, anyway for this? We were just told they can't lv for our
           schedules to accomodate bill signings... Are they shut down this afternoon?

           I was planning on getting work done at the house after Piper's appt... now after the
           recently scheduled bill signing. Why do so many think my schedule is THEIR's for the
           changing at their whim??? What is the issue/purpose/etc. Who called it, etc?
