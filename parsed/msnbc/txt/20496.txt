           Governor - I just received via phone messages that you had called in regards to Annette
           Kreutzer's contact on your state blackberry. Annette's number as listed 465-5670 is her
           direct line - when she is not available I think Sunny probably answers for her. Also, the
           commissioner only just started carrying a cell phone and the number has been given to you
           and Mike only. The mail box has not been set up on it yet. Thanks, Janice
