              This didn't make it to you. It was sent back for some reason "undeliverable." Hmm

              Thought I'd stop by at noon to see ya and to pick up that pic for the Island Pub.
              Pip and Willow came by my office the other day. Pip has been insisting since I was 24 that I'm actually 25. Now
              that I'm 26 she still insists that I'm 25. So anwya, she and Willow come by my office, she half climbs up on top of
              my desk, leans forward on her elbows and says real serious , "Ivy, are you 26 now?" I said, "yep, I'll be 27 in
              July." And without missing a beat she says, "Oh my gosh, you're almost 30. When you going to start having
              babies?" I said, "well if you stop being so picky about the people I date, I might get married and have babies."
              HA.

              Anyway, turns out it was a fitting conversation . Have a good day and I 'll see you later w/ or w/out coffee...
