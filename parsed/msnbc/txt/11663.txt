             Very, very disappointing, but also seems to be par for the course : too many
             " disclosures "/ leaks that only aim to undermine this effort. This is unacceptable.



             Joe- pls find out everything you can on this. It's unacceptable. Please enlist whomever
             else you must in order to find out who leaked... because it must, and will, stop.



             John, if you can find out anything, please do. Who attended the meetings?

             My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
             obviously provided it.  I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
             relationship we hope to have with the delegation.



             in our debrief with the gas team afterwards, we discussed each DC meeting and what, if
             anything, we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
             meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts, and I have requested
             this but have not heard back.



             Senator Stevens is adamant (and probably so is Senator Murkowski ).  In our collective
             opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform , not cut off communications.



             Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If there
             is activity, it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the only
             game in town, and I believe that the delegation understands that.



                                                                    1

              Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
              hopefully that dialogue will help. The next big DC event is FERC's next report to
              Congress on the gasline.  Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
              FERC understand the current situation.



             Because of the importance of your question, I'm taking the liberty of adding the Governor
             to our email exchange.



             P.S.

             on a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well .              The participants
             were interested and receptive.

             Jan 30 :   Mr. AGIA goes to Washington




             Fast week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update back
             to Alaska's Congressional delegation.

             With a year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR Deputy
             Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska Senators.

             in a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Irwin and
             Rutherford encountered Senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both Stevens and
             Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.

             Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't listen
             last time."

             And, at one point, Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
             AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."

             As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
             pipeline.
