                  As confirmed in Molly's attorney file (Bobby Irwin), there have been NO complaints filed by the Heath or Palin
                 family. Jason Moore stated we filed 15 complaints and only three were substantiated . KTVA claimed we filed 36
                 complaints ! And John Cyr stumbled on that question with dead silence when he was asked about it ... There have
                 been no formal complaints,
                    If Wait tries to go there, my response is "nice try", he can try to deflect from the reasons he was let go by blaming
                .it on the Wooten issue, but he knows it's not true and perhaps he doesn 't want a public discussion about his
                 administrative skills being made public.
