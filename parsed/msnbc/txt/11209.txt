           MESSAGE:

           Stick to the plan and give your State of the State speech at 6pm and go see your son
           graduate from boot camp. It would be nice if Ms Green could see that your dedication to
           our state, your family and an American soldier far outweighs her politics.

           Tell your son I and all Alaskans thank him for his service.
