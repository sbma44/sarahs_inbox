                 Governor,
                 This is such a lovely thing to do for the state employees and I want to thank you for your thoughtfulness.
                 So many of the state's employees work very hard and do not have the perks enjoyed by the private
                 sector. I believe this is the first time in at least 16 years that I remember anything like this happening.
                 In case I do not see you before Christmas, I hope you and your family have a wonderful Holiday! Thank
                 you for all you do and who you are. I believe Alaska is blessed with you leading our state.
                 Marty

                 Subject : December 24 Schedule

                 Governor Palin has announced that all non-essential state employees will be excused from duty on the
                 afternoon of December 24, 2007. This applies to all employees except for those who, in the judgment of
                 management, cannot be excused for reasons of public safety or other essential public business. This
                 would include but is not limited to certain employees of the Departments of Public Safety and Corrections,
                 as well as certain employees of the Alaska Pioneer Homes and the Alaska Psychiatric Institute.

                 All employees who are required to work on the afternoon of December 24th shall be credited with 3.5
                 hours of personal leave. Employees previously scheduled to take personal leave will have their leave
                 adjusted by 3.5 hours.

                 The Governor appreciates all the hard work of state employees and is pleased that this will give you more
                 time with your families. This leave is not discretionary and non-essential state offices will be closed. The
                 Governor is also encouraging liberal leave for the morning of December 24, but this must be pre-
                 approved by your supervisor and accompanied by a leave slip.

                 I hope you enjoy Christmas Eve and the entire Holiday Season.

                        Commentary

                        When Achieve's American Diploma Project
                         (ADP) Network was founded at the 2005

                        (Texas and Arkansas) had graduation
                        requirements rigorous enough to prepare
                        students for success in college and careers. The
                        governors and state education leaders who
                        helped start the ADP Network recognized that if
                        they wanted their graduates to be able to
                        compete for college and jobs in a "flat world"
                        their 20th century education standards were no
                        longer good enough. They also understood the
                        power of collaborating with and learning from
                        each other as they raised expectations.

                        Nowhere has the power of collective state
                        action been. more apparent than in the rapid
                        adoption by states of rigorous college and
                        career ready graduation requirements. What began as two states just under
                        three years ago now stands at 17, with Louisiana and Arizona taking action to
                        raise their graduation requirements just this month. For a state by state
                        comparison of the new requirements, go here.

                        Each of the states that have put new requirements in place has faced a series of
                        difficult decisions in designing and implementing its graduation policy. In which

                          subject areas should the state establish requirements and how challenging should
                          those requirements be? Should the new requirements be mandatory for all
                          students or should there be an opt- out provision? How will the state ensure that
                          courses with the same name are taught in a consistently rigorous manner across
                          the state? What are the implications for career and technical education or other
                          non traditional curricular pathways? The list goes on.

                          In order to help states navigate these issues, Achieve held a strategy session for
                          ADP states earlier this year. We invited leaders from states who had already
                          raised graduation requirements to attend so they could share their experiences
                          and lessons learned with states that were planning action. The dynamics and the
                          ideas that emerged were powerful.

                          As an outgrowth of that meeting, Achieve has developed a policy brief entititled,
                          "Aligning High School Graduation Requirements with the Real World: A Road Map
                          for States." (Download it here.) The Road Map addresses the most frequently
                          cited challenges of policy design as well as strategies for implementation,
                          communication and coalition building. It draws heavily on the experience of early
                          adopter states.

                          Raising graduation requirements is no panacea. It brings numerous capacity
                          challenges to the fore, from finding enough qualified math and science teachers
                          to ensuring students receive the support they need to succeed. But that is exactly
                          the point. Setting the bar so that all students graduate from high school prepared
                          for the real world is an important first step in addressing and resolving these
                          critical issues. Once the bar is set, it enables all of the leaders in the state, in
                          districts and in schools to focus on what really matters: doing what it takes to
                          help students succeed.

                          Policy Brief on Interim Assessments

                          School districts increasingly see interim assessments as an important element in
                          their instructional improvement strategy and are implementing interim
                          assessments district-wide in multiple grades and content areas. Yet, they face
                          significant design and implementation challenges to realizing the potential of
                          interim assessments to improve teaching and learning. The Aspen Institute
                          Education and Society Program and Achieve, Inc. partnered with the National
                          Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment to develop a policy brief
                          on the role of interim assessments in a comprehensive assessment system. The
                          goals are to clarify how interim assessments fit into the landscape of formative

                                 results of the 2007 reading and mathematics assessments, known as the
                                 Trial Urban District Assessments, or TUDAs. These assessments were
                                 given earlier this year to 4th- and 8th-grade students at eleven urban
                                 school districts at the same time as national- and state-level assessments.
                                 The study compares students' scores against the average nationally and
                                 the averages of students in other large central cities (population
                                 >250,000). Key findings show that national NAEP trends in 4th and 8th

                                          from 2003 to 2007. Eight urban districts saw a similar increase,
