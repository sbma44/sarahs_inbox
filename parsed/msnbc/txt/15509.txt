                Thank you for keeping the funding for West High , Romig and Turnagain Elementary in the capital budget.
                Hopefully next year we can get the funding for the library and the technology grant at West . I had a child
                at West this year, and two at Turnagain . Next year I will have a child at each of these schools. Your
                support of the schools is greatly appreciated.
