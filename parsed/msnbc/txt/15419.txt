           Dear Mr. Koch,




          I appreciate the City of Kenai's interest in DEC's plans for testing the Kenai River this
          summer for hydrocarbons.  As you state, it is important to make an accurate assessment of
          the effect on water quality of the new regulations requiring cleaner-burning outboard
          motors. We have noted some confusion among the public regarding our sampling plans. Lynn
          Kent, DEC's Director of Water, will contact you to discuss the full extent of our plans. I
          will be happy to follow up on any remaining concerns the City has.



          Sincerely,

          Larry Hartig
