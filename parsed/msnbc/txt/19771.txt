              Steven Howell from Parnell's campaign called in to deny replacing ads with Palin's name in it.
              He said it was coincedental that the ad was changed, they placed the buy a few weeks ago, and
              that an ad with Palin will run again in a few weeks.



              Kristi Green/Leaf/Babcock just called in to defend Chuck Kopp. She said he's a great guy, loved
              in the community, and she doesn't believe the sexual abuse allegations.

                Just listened to Ramras on Fagan. He said Baily and Frye are fine enough people but
                he's not worried about what is found on them in the emails. What he's worried about is
                fine individuals like John Bitney and Mike Tibbles. Also, Todd Palin has been doing
                more than literacy campaigns and breast cancer awareness and that's clear. Ramras says
                he saw you going from office to office durin ACES. He's also watching with amusement
                Sean's chameleon act, and said he should have been running his own campaign all
                along. Dan played the clips of Sean's ads. One with Sarah's name in it, and the other
                without it. Frank, did Sean really do this??
