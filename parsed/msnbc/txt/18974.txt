         Thanks so much John. Good information.




         If you can spare Larry for a couple of hours while he's up here, I'd like for him to sit
         with us in discussions regarding Alaskan media (and national)... I've asked Sharon and
         Beth to make Thursday afternoon available for that. And we may even let him return to DC
         afterwards.

        Regarding the Congressional delegation and Lisa Murkowski, we followed the roll-out plan.
        Within minutes of the press release, we contacted the delegation through their
        transportation staffers with the expectation that they would advise their principals.
        This is the normal way we have been communicating with the delegation on the bridges.



        The DC portion of the roll-out plan grew out of discussions with Juneau.                      Privileged or Pe

         Mike/ Rues : His presser makes it sound like he and the community were shocked this morning.
         What was the specific communications with him, Rep Johansan, the community leaders, the
         delgation, etc. in all these weeks/months - especially the communications with affected
         legislators this past week as the press release was getting ready to be sent? What was
         their reaction throughout the week?
