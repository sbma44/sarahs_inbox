               I noticed that there's a short but very good editorial in today's ADN about our
               earmark policy.

               I believe that Matt decided not to publish my Op-Ed piece on the grounds that the
               subject matter has received enough coverage by them. But, I'd like to think that he
               felt a little bit guilty and then decided to write his own editorial, which is probably a
               better result anyway.

               Perhaps, another newspaper which has not devoted as much coverage to earmarks
               would be willing to publish the Op-Ed. I think it's a reasonable summary of the
               current situation in DC and does contain some new information on transportation
               earmarks, which precipitated the problem to begin with.




                       Earmarks

                       Pork with a sense of proportion

                       Sen. Ted Stevens complains that Gov. Palm's anti-earmark rhetoric is hurting
                       Alaska's cause in Congress . It's harder for him to get federal funding for Alaska
                       projects, he says, when critics can say your own state doesn 't like earmarks.

                       Maybe so. But the Palin administration hasn't said all earmarks are evil. It has
                       merely scaled back the state's list of funding requests, using some sensible
                       criteria, like whether the project involves any federal responsibility and has
                       strong public support.

                       The governor recognizes that legitimate federal funding requests may come
                       from other sources, like local governments and the university.

                       In short, when it comes to federal pork, Gov. Palin is talking about reduced
                       portions, not going without. That's the reality these days, thanks to past
                       earmarking excesses. Cutting the list of earmark requests and using tighter
                       criteria to screen them should make it easier to defend the Alaska projects that
                       do get federal funding.

                  "I believe it's inappropriate to stuff a supplemental budget with a package of last
                  year's vetoed capital projects, especially when the adminstration has not even
                  seen the growing list of legislator's projects they've apparently now added to the
                  supplemental budget. Supplemental budgets traditionally, and appropriately,
                  fund end-of-year shortfalls due to unexpected costs, usually in operations of
                  public services provided by government. The capital budget should be developed
                  in a comprehensive manner."

                  Rep. Meyer told Bill McAllister that the budget has / will be moved out with the
                  capital projects IN. BM wants comment from the administration . Please advise.
