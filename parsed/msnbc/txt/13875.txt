            Thanks Kristan- I emailed Talis to ask what can be done. Thanks so much for your dogged
            determination on this issue.

            Governor, I am sure this is no surprise to you ( see email correspondence below), but
            pretty frustrating.  I guess we have not choice but to.just wait. Kristan

           Will do, I appreciate your patience. The sad thing as this is norm across the state. The
           DA's are way understaffed, so they take the serious offenses against people before the
           property crimes. Derek

            Not really. They are backed up because there are not enough prosecutors. Calling would
            likely just tick him off. I plan on scheduling a meeting with him within the next couple
            of weeks to go over the case, so I hope that will start the process.




            If you need to get an update, let them know prosecution is pending ... I wish there was
            more. Derek

            Is there anything I can do to get the DA to "DO" something? I need to give an update and
            would sure like to be able to share something other than the DA still hasn't even read the
            report.  Thanks, Kristan

            Nothing, sorry. I met with the DA last week and he had not read the report yet. I
            suggested a meeting soon to discuss where this case is going in an attempt to get him to
            commit. I will let you know when I know more. Thanks, Derek
