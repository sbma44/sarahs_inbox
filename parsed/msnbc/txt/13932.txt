              We need to wrap up supplemental decision so I can follow through on my committment to
             give lawmakers plenty of time to figure out how to plug their vetoed projects into capital
             budget. Today's my last day mtg with them- we need to act tonight or tomorrow. And
             press/Alaskans need to hear a powerful message , via seeing Mike's list, of how screwy this
             has gotten under Bert. We need to be adament about this.

              Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill

              McAllister, Stephen M., Kristina?? On the second floor about the capital

              budget - told them there are significant items missing that are basic

              health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some examples

              like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big

              differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED

              grants - approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly

              there has to be a responsible budget by the end and that we will

              continue to work toward that.



              They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental -

              told them we still have a few more meetings with legislators - that I

              didn't think we would be able to do much before Thursday -

              We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't

              let their issues go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are

              working on it.

              Governor-



              I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

              could cover budget items as well as CON.

              Great work last night that resulted in that very , very valuable list

              that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

              screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks .             I am ready

              to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

              outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what ' s going on here so they can

              pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
