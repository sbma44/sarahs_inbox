             What we have just started is for me to go through all the requests with Kris and Kari. We are placing items on the
             schedule as tentative based on the location and type of event. Those will show on your calendar and will be easy to
             see and for you to give final approval. We will then be able to assign a lead person and begin doing our staff work
             to prepare. The other items are being typed up into a proposed regret list. You will be able to scan through and
             decide if we are making the correct reccomendation. You will also have a list of items that you can refer to in case
             you are questioned during your travels.

             I have a folder for you today and you can let me know if you think the process will work for you. Thanks.

             Mike

            Mike - has the gov's office been invited to many June/July events lately? I have seen no requests - wondering is
            there a better way for me to keep up with requests -vs- waiting to get to Juno to read the hard copies of requests that
            land on Kari's desk? I'd think it would be easy to start faxing and emailing all requests to the Anch office also,
            and/or to my home office so I won't be missing the many events that Alaskans are expecting. NOT a long and
            difficult exercise - short and sweet just telling me when and where and I can judge from there whether I should go or
            send someone.

            Pls have Kari begin this today . Thank you
