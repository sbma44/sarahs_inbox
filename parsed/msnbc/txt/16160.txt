                 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                               No. 08-060

                                  Governors Urge Congress to Support Energy Security Programs


                 June 17, 2008, Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin and Governor Joe Manchin III of West
                 Virginia are urging Congress to support federal -state programs that assist states in promoting energy
                 security . Governor Manchin is chair of the Natural Resources Committee for the National Governors
                 Association , and Governor Palin serves as vice chair.

                 Given recent energy price increases and projected long-term growth in energy demand , both governors
                 are calling on Congress to support efforts to conserve energy resources while actively seeking to
                 diversify supplies by expanding renewable resources.

                 In a joint letter, Governors Palin and Manchin urged members of the House and Senate Appropriations
                 Committees to fully fund the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act
                 of 2007.

                 "We can't afford to just talk about energy security," said Governor Palin. "In these uncertain economic
                 times, states must leverage investments to promote efficient renewable energy projects."
                 The National Governors Association promotes visionary state leadership , shares best practices and
                 speaks with a unified voice on national policy. Its members are the governors of the 50 states and five
                 territories.
