                                                           March 14, 2008

                          a bi-weekly update on U.S. Department of Education activities relevant to the
                             Intergovernmental and Corporate community and other stakeholders




               MATH EDUCATION

               Yesterday (March 13), the National Mathematics Advisory Panel released its final report. The panel,
               created by President Bush in April 2006, was charged with making recommendations to the
               President and the Secretary on the best use of scientifically based research to advance the teaching
               and learning of mathematics, with a specific focus on preparation for and success in algebra (grades
               PK-8). Why algebra? It is a "demonstrable gateway to later achievement," needed for higher math
               in high school. Also, completion of Algebra II correlates significantly with success in college and
               future earnings. Panelists, including mathematicians, cognitive psychologists, and educators, held 12
               meetings across the country (receiving testimony from 200 individuals and 150 organizations),
               reviewed 16,000 studies, and scrutinized surveys from 743 algebra teachers. The result is 45 findings
               and recommendations on a range of items, including instructional practices, materials, assessments,
               and teacher professional development. Below are some highlights.

               Core Principles of Math Instruction

                    The areas to be studied from pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade should be streamlined,
                     and a well-defined set of the most important topics should be emphasized in the early grades.
                     Any approach that revisits topics year after year -- without brining them to closure -- should
                     be avoided.
                    Proficiency with whole numbers, fractions, and aspects-of geometry and measurement are the
                     foundations for algebra. Of these, knowledge of fractions is the most important skill not
                     developed among American students.
                    Conceptual understanding, computational and procedural fluency, and problem-solving skills
                     are equally important and mutually reinforce each other.

                ED Review (03/14/08)                                                                               Page 2 of 5


                     Students should develop immediate recall of arithmetic facts to free the "working memory" for
                       solving more complex problems.
                     More students should be prepared for and offered an "authentic" algebra course in the eighth-grade.
                      The major topics of school algebra include symbols and expressions, linear equations, quadratic
                      equations, functions, polynomials, and combinatorics and finite probability.


                Effective Instruction Matters

                     Teachers' regular use of formative assessments can improve student learning.
                     The belief that children of particular ages cannot learn certain content because they are "too young"
                      or "not ready" has consistently been shown to be false.
                     Explicit instruction for students who struggle is effective in increasing learning.
                     Gifted students should be allowed to accelerate their learning.
                     Publishers should produce shorter, more focused, and more mathematically accurate textbooks. The
                      excessive length of some U.S. textbooks is not necessary for high achievement.



                Other Findings

                    Much of the public' s "resignation" about math education is based on the erroneous idea that success
                     comes from inherent talent or ability, not effort. A focus on the importance of effort in learning will
                     improve outcomes . If students believe that their efforts to learn make them "smarter ," they show
                     greater persistence in learning.
                    Teachers' math knowledge is important for students' achievement . The preparation of elementary
                     and middle school educators should be strengthened . Also, the use of teachers who have specialized
                     in elementary math could be an alternative to increasing all elementary teachers ' content knowledge
                     by focusing the need for expertise on a fewer teachers.
                    The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and state assessments in math should be
                     improved in quality and should emphasize the most critical knowledge and skills leading to algebra.



                The Department will convene a national summit based on the recommendations of the panel. FOR MORE

               NCLB UPDATE

               Continuing her national tour, Secretary Spellings visited three more states to discuss critical issues in K-12
               education: North Carolina (3/5), West Virginia (3/7), and New York (3/10). Moreover, maximizing the
               agency's outreach, Deputy Secretary Ray Simon visited four states : Arkansas (3/10), Colorado (3/12), North
               Dakota (3/13), and New Mexico (3/14). At each location, they presented state-specific No Child Left Behind
               information from a new tool recently unveiled by the Department (see
               http://www.ed.gov/nclb/accountability/results /-pro ess/). These two-page "dashboards" provide
               statistics on state and NAEP test scores, graduation rates, schools making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP),
               highly qualified teachers , parents taking advantage of choice and supplemental educational service options,
               state participation in flexibility options, and more. The simple format, with charts and graphs, reveals bright
               spots as well as concerns . Next week, using feedback from these visits, the Secretary will announce a series
               of assessment and accountability actions.

                On March 6, the Secretary delivered poignant remarks at the Reading First State Directors Conference.
                "Just last week, we learned that, for the first time, more than one out of every 100 Americans is
                incarcerated," she said. "Reducing these numbers starts early. It starts with giving our young people the
                knowledge and skills to succeed in school and in the workforce. I don't need to tell you that reading opens
                the door to history, science, literature, geography, and more. Reading opens the door to opportunity. So,
                instead of cutting funding for programs that are proven to work, let's make them more available!" In Fiscal
                Year 2008, Congress cut funding for Reading First by 61%. President Bush has proposed restoring funding
                to $1 billion. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

               In a letter to Chief State School Officers (http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/saapr5.pdf , Assistant
               Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Kerri Briggs announced the Department's revised peer
               review process for science assessments . Responding to concerns that the process is not transparent and
               does not furnish timely feedback, she is offering states the opportunity to have face-to-face conversations
               with peers and receive technical assistance from these experts. Also, in keeping with changes made last fall,
               states may select one of the peers from the list of approved experts for the state's review. This is the first
               year science assessments are required to be administered once each in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12. The
               assessments are not included in determinations of AYP.



               AMERICAN STARS

               The Department is still accepting nominations for its 2008 American Stars of Teaching awards, which
               recognize educators who are boosting student achievement -- using innovative instructional strategies -- and
               making a difference in the lives of their students. Anyone (students, parents, colleagues, administrators, etc.)
               can nominate an American Star. After the Department receives a nomination, a verification form is sent to
               the teacher's principal. One teacher will be recognized from each state and the District of Columbia. The
               deadline for nominations is March 31. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

              . TRANSFORMING HIGHER EDUCATION

               Today (Match 14), Secretary Spellings testified before the House Committee on Education and Labor on
               the availability of federal student loans. "Recent volatility in credit markets has raised some concern about
               the continued availability of student loans," she said . "I want to reassure you that federal student aid --
               grants, loans through both the Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs, and
               work-study -- will continue to be available to students and their families ." FOR MORE INFORMATION,

                INTEL SCIENCE AWARDS

                On March 13, Secretary Spellings joined Intel Chairman Craig Barrett to honor Intel Science Talent Search
                (STS) finalists. STS is America's oldest (1942) and most prestigious high school science competition . (Since
                1998, STS has been sponsored by Intel .) More than 1,600 students entered the contest this year; the 40
                finalists hailed from 19 states and 35 high schools . The top prize went to Shivani Sud of Durham, North
                Carolina, who developed a model that analyzed the specific "molecular signatures " of tumors from patients
                with Stage II colon cancer. She then used this information to identify those at higher risk for tumor
                recurrence and propose potentially effective drugs for treatment. She joins some esteemed alumni: six

                "This [National Mathematics Advisory Panel] report represents the first comprehensive analysis of math
                education to be based on sound science. The panel's findings and recommendations make very clear what
                must be done to help our children succeed in math. We must teach number and math concepts early, we
                must help students believe they can improve their math skills, and we must ensure they fully comprehend
                algebra concepts by the time they graduate from high school. The panel's extensive work will benefit
                generations of American students."
