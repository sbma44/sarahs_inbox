I have Nikiski on hold until I am told whether or not you need that day for budget work or special
session work. It's on my list to go over with COS today. I'm assuming we would need to fly there via
King Air?

I still don't see the confirmed fundraiser on any of the schedules in front of me. And is the Nikiski
event on the 27th a go - or still tentative?

Governor, Todd will not be available on June 26 for the Cathi Geerin

hockey fundraiser dinner at the Anch Sheraton. Should I regret your

attendance, or confirm it? Thanks, Kari.
