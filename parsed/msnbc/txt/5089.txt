                  Subject: North Pacific Fishery Management Council

                Tibbles and Nzich,

                Mr. Merrigan was appointed to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council . In cases of Federal boards, it
                seems as though it would be more difficult to remove members because of the Congressional confirmation that is
                needed . Please advise if you would like me to pull out any new applications that have come in for the Council.

                Thank you for your time.

                Alaskan appointed to fishery council
                ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A long- time Alaska fisherman is the newest member of the North
                Pacific Fishery Management Council.

                Gerald P . Merrigan of Petersburg has been tapped to serve on the council until August 10th, 2009.
