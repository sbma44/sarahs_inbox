             We shouldn't wait 'til morning. The dept of Ed will have a presser , so me chiming in
             tonight is most appropriate instead of waiting and missing tonight's and tomorrow's print
             deadlines. So, pls wk with them on getting my take on it in their presser . We'll be two
             days behind if we wait.

             Governor, we asked Frank to ask Larry to please not talk to the press yet. We wanted to
             get your approval for the press release before it went out. We could do this in the
             morning, if you'd like.

             Dear Governor,



             As you already know , we have a new commissioner of education! It took awhile, but we're
             finally there ! Mike and Lynne helped guide me through this process - they gave me good
             advice and it made a huge difference .   I regret that this process took longer than
             expected , so thank you for hanging in there - it was worth it.



             Take care, BAT
