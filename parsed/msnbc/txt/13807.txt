                  hasn't.
                  6. The portion of dues local PTAs send to state
                  and national PTA is low ( only $1 . 75 to national
                  and a few dollars to state ), but the return on
                  investment is very high. PTO Today claims to be
                  cheap - but you get what you pay for. (See

                  filled web site ; 8 national print and e-
                  newsletters, as well as state newsletters and web
                  sites; 10 e-learning courses; live workshops; and

                  Today offers are much more limited and
                  narrower in scope.
                  8. PTA welcomes and works with all people
                  interested in children and education , as well as a
                  wide variety of national , not-for-profit groups
                  and non-PTA parent groups to ensure that each
                  child has a good start in life . PTO Today has no
                  such reach.
                  9. PTA's loss of membership - touted by PTO
                  Today as proof PTA doesn't work - reflects losses
                  across the entire not-for-profit world , as the pace
                  of life and time for volunteering for any
                  organization has decreased for everyone. PTA is
                  nearly 6 million members strong - still a
                  formidable advocate working successfully for
                  children, families , and education.

                  Does anyone care about state rights anymore? They are not only Federalizing, but in fact
                  Corporatizing our nation. Where it the ever loving outrage on the parts of the States???

                  Thursday March 20th, 2008                                                       informationliberation.com
                  Carlyle Group May Buy Major CIA Contractor : Booz Allen Hamilton (CorpWatch)
                  The Carlyle Group, one of the world 's largest private equity funds , may soon acquire the $2 billion
                  government contracting business of consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the biggest suppliers
                  of technology and personnel to the U . S. government's spy agencies . Carlyle manages more than $75
                  billion in assets and has bought and sold a long string of military contractors since the early I 990s. But
                  in recent years it has significantly reduced its investments in that industry. If it goes ahead with the
                  widely reported plan to buy Booz Allen , it will re-emerge as the owner of one of America 's largest
                  private intelligence armies.

                  Reports of a potential Carlyle acquisition of Booz Allen 's government unit began circulating among U.S.
                  military contractors in December 2007, after Booz Allen 's senior partners and board members - a group
                  of 300 vice presidents who own the privately -held firm - gathered at company headquarters in McLean,
                  Virginia, for an extraordinary two-day meeting.

                  According to a December 15 letter to Booz Allen employees from CEO Ralph W. Shrader that was
                  released by the firm, the vice presidents signed off on a "new strategic direction" that would involve
                  separating the company 's commercial and government units and operating them as separate
                  companies. That was widely seen , both inside and outside the company, as a sign that a sale of one or
                  both of the units was imminent Shrader said the company hoped to come to a resolution of the issues
                  involved by March 31, 2008.

                 In January 2008 , major newspapers - each quoting unnamed people close to the situation - reported
                 that discussions between Booz Allen and Carlyle about the sale of the government unit were underway.
                 According to the Wall Street Journal , the deal will be "centered on Booz Allen's influence in defense
                 and intelligence contracting . If an agreement is reached the sale price will likely be around $2 billion."

                 Christopher Ullman , Carlyle's chief spokesman , could neither confirm nor deny that a deal was in the
                 works, and declined to comment to CorpWatch about the reports . Because of Carlyle's long experience
                 in the defense sector, he added , such companies "would be a priority for us when the price is right and
                 its the right fit for us." George Farrar , a Booz Allen spokesman , said his company "has refused to
                 discuss particulars of any ongoing discussions " and would not comment beyond what Shrader wrote in
                 his December 15 missive to Booz Allen's workforce.

                 Who Is Booz Allen Hamilton?

                 In 2006 , Booz Allen Hamilton , a privately held company based in McLean, Virginia, had a global staff of
                 18,000 and annual revenues of $3.7 billion . Its work for U.S. government agencies accounts for more
                 than 50 percent of its business. Notably Booz Allen is a key adviser and prime contractor to all of the

                  major U.S. intelligence agencies - the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency
                  (DIA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the
                  National Security Agency (NSA), and - as well as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the National
                  Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense and most of the Pentagon 's combatant commands.

                  On its website , Booz Allen describes its intelligence work as part of its broader expertise in information
                  technology . "Whether dealing with homeland security , peacekeeping operations , or the battlefield , success
                  depend on the ability to collect , safeguard, store, distribute, fuse, and share information - on getting the right
                  information to the right place at the right time," it says . "Our security professionals work in partnership with
                  clients to develop capabilities ... for protecting information and networks against cyber and physical threats."

                  That has not always been the case : Booz Allen Hamilton was founded as a management consultancy in 1914
                  in Chicago by three businessmen whose surnames gave the firm its name . In 1940 , after more than three
                  decades of giving advice to top ranking companies in America 's manufacturing and service economy , such as
                  Montgomery Ward , Goodyear Tire and the Illinois State Railroad , Booz Allen started working for the U.S.
                  military, where its clients included the Army, the Navy, and, after the war, the Air Force and the Pentagon.

                  Its initial contracts with the Navy in 1940 set the pace for its military work: as a management consultant, Booz
                  Allen helped the Navy restructure for World War II and permeated its ranks with contractors (" Each Navy
                  bureau had a Booz rep ," Investors Daily reported in a 2005 profile of the firm). That relationship served as a
                  template for Booz Allen 's later work in intelligence and national security where its personnel worked inside
                  government agencies alongside public employees.

                 Since the late-1990s , Booz Allen has forged a particularly close relationship with the NSA, the spy agency that
                 monitors global telephone, e-mail and Internet traffic for the U.S. military and political leaders, which hired Booz
                 Allen as its chief outside consultant on Project Groundbreaker . This $4 billion project outsourced the NSA's
                 internal communications and networking systems to a consortium led by Computer Sciences Corporation
                 (CSC) and the IT subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.

                 Today, among the many services Booz Allen provides to intelligence agencies , according to its Website, are
                 war-gaming - simulated drills in which military and intelligence officials test their response to potential threats
                 like terrorist attacks - as well as data-mining and analysis of imagery and intelligence picked up by U.S. spy
                 satellites, the design of cryptographic , or code-breaking , systems (an NSA specialty) and
                 "outsourcing/privatization strategy and planning." The company's 2007 annual report spells out several other
                 areas of expertise , including "all source analysis," an intelligence specialty managed by the CIA and the Office
                 of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) that draws on public sources of information , such as foreign
                 newspapers and textbooks , to add texture to data gathered by spies and electronic surveillance.

                 According to the company 's annual report, Booz Allen is also working on one of the most important spy
                 initiatives launched in recent years : the Cryptographic Modernization Program . Air Force General John C.
                 Koziol , the commander of the Air Force Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency , described this
                 program as an attempt to combine a variety of intelligence technologies to pick up tell-tale signs of chemicals
                 and other substances - into a single electronic package that can be used by combat and special operations
                 commanders to track the enemy.

                 Booz Allen is a full partner in the project, according to General Koziol, an idea that has been "fully endorsed" by
                 the Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell, the nation's spy chief - himself a Booz Allen alumnus.

                  hired a dazzling array of former national security officials and foot -soldiers. In 2002, Information Week reported
                  that Booz Allen had more than 1,000 former intelligence officers on its payroll . In 2007, as this reporter was
                  researching a chapter about Booz Allen for his forthcoming book , he asked the company if it could confirm that
                  number or provide a more accurate one , and received an e-mail reply from spokesman George Farrar: "It is
                  certainly possible , but as a privately held corporation we consider that information to be proprietary and do not
                  disclose."

                  Buried deep on the company 's Web site, however, a much larger number is confirmed in an explanation of a
                  Booz Allen information technology contract with the DIA , which carries out intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of
                  Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense . It stated that the Booz Allen team "employs more than 10,000
                  TS/SCI cleared personnel ." TS/SCI stands for top secret-sensitive compartmented intelligence , one of the
                  highest possible security ratings , which would make Booz Allen one of the largest employers of cleared
                  personnel in the United States.

                  Many of these former intelligence officers at Booz Allen, do the same jobs as they did for the government. For
                  example , Keith Hall , a Booz Allen vice president initially worked in Army intelligence and on one of the
                  congressional intelligence committees . In the early 1990s, he was hired by the CIA to manage budgets and
                  policy development for then-Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates. During that time, he played an
                  instrumental role in creating the National Imagery and Mapping Agency , which was later renamed the National
                  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency . During the Clinton administration , Hall was named Assistant Secretary of the
                  Air Force for space programs and, simultaneously , director of the NRO, the agency that manages the nation's
                  military satellite program.

                 Now, as a Booz Allen executive , Hall leads a "strategic intelligence initiative" that integrates the company's
                 extensive contracting activities for the NRO and the NGA. Recently , one of his most important tasks involved
                 chairing a 2005 homeland security study group that recommended a major expansion of information and data-
                 sharing between U.S. spy agencies that work outside the country and domestic law enforcement, like the
                 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). "The study 's findings have become a road map for the government in
                 making decisions related to critical information sharing in support of homeland security ," Booz Allen boasts in
                 its 2007 annual report. (See our article, Domestic Spying, Inc.)

                 Other key executives who came to Booz Allen from the spy agencies include R . James Woolsey, the former
                 director of the CIA, who was hired in 2003 to run Booz Allen 's "global resilience" division , which advises
                 corporations on security issues , and Joan A. Dempsey, a career U . S. intelligence official and a former top aide
                 to former CIA Director George Tenet, who was hired in 2005 as a Booz Allen vice pr other key intelligence
                 agencies.

                 It is these senior managers who would most likely benefit from a sale to Carlyle.

                 Unlike many of its competitors in the intelligence industry , Booz Allen is a privately held company whose shares
                 are owned by its 300 vice presidents of whom "approximately 80 are in government support," Booz Allen's
                 Farrar told CorpWatch . For these vice presidents , Carlyle's infusion of capital , and its $2 billion buyout of their
                 shares , will make them very rich men and women indeed . After all, $2 billion divided by 80 is $25 million; even if
                 Booz Allen's shares were divided equally, which is unlikely , that's an astounding windfall for any executive.

                 Booz Allen CEO Ralph Shrader

                 The man most responsible for Booz Allen's growth as an intelligence contractor is Ralph Shrader , who has
                 been. running the company as chairman and CEO since 1998 . Shrader, an electrical engineer by training, came
                 to Booz Allen in 1974 after serving at senior management levels of two prominent telecommunications
                 companies - Western Union , where he was national director of advanced systems planning , and RCA, where
                 he served in the company 's government communications system division . These positions prepared him well
                 for his later work at Booz Allen as a consultant to the telecommunications industry . According to his official
                 biography, he "led major assignments" for the industry as a Booz Allen consultant and was deeply involved in
                 the company's "landmark work for AT&T' when that company was broken up by the government.

                 In those assignments , Shrader may have been exposed to the telecommunications industry's close ties to U.S.
                 intelligence . During the years he worked for Western Union and RCA, those companies , along with ITT World
                 Communications, were part of a secret surveillance program known as Minaret in which telecommunication
                 companies, with the concurrence of a handful of high-ranking executives, handed over to the NSA information

                  on all incoming and outgoing U.S. telephone calls and telegrams - an early version of the NSA's warrantless
                  surveillance program launched by the Bush administration after the September 11th attacks . Minaret, and the
                  involvement of the private companies in NSA spying , was exposed by the congressional committees
                  investigating intelligence abuse in the mid-1970s, and was the inspiration behind the 1978 Foreign Intelligence
                  Surveillance Act (FISA), which set the rules - including the important requirement for warrants - for domestic
                  surveillance of telephone traffic.

                  None of this is alluded to in Booz Allen 's official literature , of course; but Shrader, upon his appointment as
                  CEO in 1998 , mentioned in a rare press interview (with the Financial Times ) that the most relevant background
                  for his new position of chief executive was his experience working for telecommunications clients and doing
                  classified military work for the U.S. government - "something of a Booz specialty," the FT pointed out.

                  Booz Allen adds on its website that Shrader , as CEO , has also "led important programs for the U . S. National
                  Communications System and the Defense Information Systems Agency ," two of the most important classified
                  intelligence networks in use by the federal government . Under Shrader, Booz Allen also became the NSA's
                  most important outside consultant, culminating in its advisory role in Project Groundbreaker . That project, which
                  awarded its first contracts in the summer of 2001 , put Booz Allen in a prime position to capture NSA and other
                  intelligence work in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks , when intelligence budgets , and NSA
                  surveillance , increased substantially.

                  "War on Terror" Contracts

                  After September 11th, 2001 , by Booz Allen's own account , the firm helped the government reshape its spying
                  capabilities to match the new era of counterinsurgencies and terrorist threats . "The nature of intelligence
                  changed dramatically in the wake of 9/11," Christopher Ling, a Booz Allen vice president , explains in the
                  company's most recent annual report . "An entire analytic production system geared to detect large -scale cold
                  war adversarial capabilities was suddenly required to transform ." At Booz Allen , he added , "We are finding
                  innovative ways to integrate intelligence and operations , enabled by advanced visualization and data
                  management capabilities, which has allowed us to pioneer tactics , techniques, and procedures."

                  In addition to serving as a prime contractor on Admiral John Poindexter 's controversial Total Information
                  Awareness project , Booz Allen was active on both the military and economic fronts on the "war on terror." For
                  the Pentagon , it helped develop the "blue force " tracking system that allows soldiers and commanders in Iraq
                  and other battlegrounds the ability to electronically identify friendly troops. And in the weeks leading up to the
                  invasion of Iraq , Booz Allen sponsored and organized several conferences aimed at helping U . S. corporations
                  secure contracts in occupied Baghdad , with former CIA director Woolsey , one of the most ardent backers of the
                  war, as a keynote speaker.

                  Under Shrader's leadership , Booz Allen played an instrumental role after September 11th in proselytizing for a
                  greater corporate role in national and homeland security. This was important , the Booz Allen CEO said at a
                  CEO summit he organized in 2002 , because "business leaders cannot opt out of geopolitics and leave the job
                  of security solely to government and the military."

                  Deepening the corporate alliance with the Bush administration and its war on terror also had significant
                  advantages for Booz Allen and its fellow corporations : on one hand , it drastically increased their contracts with
                  military and intelligence agencies ; and on the other, homeland security provided a convenient excuse for
                  reducing government oversight and regulation . These dual interests were spelled out in unusual detail in 2004
                  by Richard Wilhelm , a former CIA and NSA officer who once served as national security adviser to former Vice
                  President Al Gore and now leads Booz Allen's business with the CIA and the Office of the DNI.

                 Speaking to a conference on information -sharing and counterterrorism , Wilhelm explained that the "right mix of
                 policies" for business should include a wide range of "incentives" and "cooperative arrangements ," including
                 "appropriate protections from Freedom of Information Act requirements and other unintended consequences of
                 more open information sharing ." Government, he argued , should "help make the business case, and then
                 sweeten it - because industry will share information when there is a business case to do so." In other words,
                 corporations were happy to participate in the exchange of information about terrorism and other security
                 threats, but only if there were enough rewards . And for Booz Allen , those rewards have been sweet indeed, as
                 a short list of their recent unclassified contracts attests . They include:

                  Little Congressional Scrutiny?

                  In spite of its tremendous power as a contractor , Booz Allen has received very little criticism or even scrutiny
                  from the U. S. Congress . In January 2007, the Senate had a rare opportunity to inquire about the company
                  when it held hearings on Michael McConnell 's nomination as Director of National Intelligence (see box). Prior to
                  the hearing , several senators said they would question McConnell about Booz Allen's role as a contractor; but
                  the hearing was a desultory affair, and few questions were asked of the new DNI about the high level of
                  contracting among the spy agencies or the specific role of Booz Allen.

                  A month later, a Booz Allen contract with the Department of Homeland Security came under close scrutiny in
                  the House . In February 2007 , Henry Waxman , a Democratic Congressman from California, the chairman of the
                  House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform , charged that Booz Allen had a significant conflict of
                  interest over its contract to oversee an $8 billion contract with the DHS Secure Border Initiative known as SBI-
                  Net. Under the contract, Boeing and other companies will build a "virtual fence" of cameras, radar and sensors
                  that will transmit imagery and data to border patrol agents working along the U.S . borders with Canada and
                  Mexico . (See CorpWatch 's "Fencing the Border".)

                  The conflict arose , said Waxman , because Booz Allen had long-standing business partnerships with Boeing,
                  the prime contractor for SBI -Net, and could therefore not provide objective oversight of the program. At the
                  hearing , Waxman pointed out to DHS officials that they had hired 98 people to oversee the SBI -Net contract.
                  "But the problem is that 65 of these people don 't work for the government. They work for the contractor," he
                  said. "You're relying on them to do the function that a government ordinarily would do." DHS officials responded
                  that Booz Allen had been hired for advice , not for oversight.

                 Waxman's criticism could be made of a myriad of contracts Booz Allen holds with intelligence agencies. At the
                 NSA, for example, it has advised the agency about several contracts that involve companies that Booz Allen
                 has close business ties with . That is also true at the N RO, the NGA and the CIA . So far, however, no reports of
                 conflicts of interest have emerged from Congress , which in any case exercises little oversight over intelligence
                 contracts.

                 In another damaging report issued in 2007 , the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of the U . S. Congress,
                 found that the Department of Homeland Security was spending nearly $16 billion a year on goods and services
                 from the private sector, making it the third -largest employer of contractors in the federal government. Among
                 the beneficiaries of DHS ' spending was Booz Allen Hamilton , which in 2006 was awarded a $43 million no-bid
                 contract to provide services to the DHS intelligence unit. Upon reading the $16 billion DHS figures in the GAO
                 report, Joseph Lieberman , an independent U.S. senator from Connecticut , angrily commented : "plainly put, we
                 need to know who is in charge at DHS - its managers and workers, or the contractors."

                 The Washington Post later found that Booz Allen 's no-bid intelligence contract with DHS had ballooned in value
                 from $2 million in 2003 to over $30 million in 2006 - 15 times its original value . When DHS lawyers first
                 examined the Booz Allen deal, the Post said, they found it was "grossly beyond the scope" of the original

                  contract and had violated government procurement rules . An open competition was ordered by DHS lawyers,
                  but delayed for a year. During that time, the Post said , " the payments to Booz Allen more than doubled again
                  under a second no-bid arrangement , to $73 million."

                  Union Protests

                  So far, the only public criticism of the potential Carlyle -Booz Allen deal has come from the Service Employees
                  International Union (SEIU), one of the country's largest labor unions . Last year, the union launched a blistering
                  attack on Carlyle and the private equity industry in a widely distributed report called " Behind the Buyouts : Inside
                  the World of Private Equity ." The gist of the report was that Carlyle, Kohlberg , Kravis, Roberts (KKR) and other
                  large private equity funds were undermining the U.S . economy by avoiding taxes and creating "harsh
                  consequences ," such as layoffs , for workers and communities . In late 2007 , when Carlyle acquired the assets
                  of Manor Care, a chain of nursing homes where the SEIU is trying to organize workers , the union stepped up its
                  campaign.

                  In January 2008, after rumors of a Carlyle takeover of Booz Allen surfaced in the press,, SEIU issued a
                  blistering press release denouncing the potential deal . The union 's criticism of the proposed acquisition didn't
                  focus on Booz Allen's role in intelligence outsourcing but on Carlyle 's ties with the Mubadala Development fund
                  of the Government of Abu Dhabi . In 2007, that fund paid $ 1.35 billion to buy a 7.5 percent ownership stake in
                  Carlyle's general partnership.

                  As a result of that investment, the SEIU charged , Carlyle was risking national security . "The potential for a
                  Carlyle Group-Booz Allen buyout demands urgency on the part of lawmakers and regulators to examine the
                  risks faced by the U.S. when foreign governments potentially have access to classified and other sensitive
                  national security information through their stake in U.S. companies," the union declared in a press release. In
                  an interview with CorpWatch , Stephen Lerner, the director of SEIU 's Private Equity Project, said the union
                  launched this nationalist campaign out of concern that classified information from Booz Allen could leak into the
                  hands of the Abu Dhabi fund , thus compromising U.S. security interests.

                  "When you combine buyout firms , which have much less reporting requirements because they are private, with
                  opaque sovereign wealthfunds , you get a toxic stew of secrecy ," he said. Asked how or why Booz Allen
                  executives might leak classified information to a foreign government, he replied: "The point is, you have no way
                  of knowing if they would or wouldn 't" He added that, while the SEIU has not taken a position on Booz Allen's
                  extensive role in intelligence outsourcing , the issue of "government jobs being done by private contractors"
                  might emerge in the future for the union.

                  (The SEIU does not mention in its material that the California Public Employees Retirement System, the
                  pension fund for California state retirees where the SEIU has significant influence , owns five percent of the
                  Carlyle Group.)

                 Carlyle's Ullman , who recently discussed the union campaign with SEIU president Andrew Stem during a
                 conference on private equity , rejected the SEIU's claims . The charges that the Abu Dhabi investment could
                 jeopardize national security " is really an obscene allegation ," he said . Ullman added that the Abu Dhabi fund
                 was a "passive investor" in Carlyle and would have no role in the management of Carlyle companies . "Carlyle's
                 portfolio companies have a pristine track record in handling sensitive government data ," he said . "Giving top
                 secret and classified data to foreign governments is known as treason, and is punishable by jail and worse.
                 That would be a fairly strong impediment' to leaks.

                 In any case , there is virtually no evidence to suggest that any US intelligence contractor has leaked classified
                 information , and its unlikely the union's allegations will be a factor if the Carlyle Group does decide to acquire
                 Booz Allen Hamilton.

                 Shadow Intelligence Agency

                 Booz Allen prides itself on the long-term personal relationships it has forged between its personnel and their
                 government clients . "We stay for a lifetime," Mark J. Gerencser, the senior vice president in charge of Booz
                 Allen's government contracting division , remarked in 2006 . A quick study of their biographies posted on Booz
                 Allen's Website suggests that this is indeed true - the senior management have shuttled back and forth
                 between the company and the government for their entire lives.

                 As the director of Booz Allen ' s U.S. government business , for example, Gerencser serves in "several broad-
                 based roles," including "representing industry" to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                 Staff, which manage the Pentagon 's vast intelligence operations . He is also a member of Booz Allen's
                 leadership team that sets the strategic direction of the company , and has run many of the war games staged by
                 Booz Allen for its government clients.

                 Just below him in the company 's intelligence hierarchy is Ken Weegand , another senior vice president . Weigand
                 came to Booz Allen in 1983 after working for a decade in Air Force intelligence , and now leads the firm's work
                 for national intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Department of Homeland Security. His
                 specialty , the Website says, includes imagery intelligence operations, which are managed by the NGA, one of
                 Booz Allen 's most important clients.

                 Senior vice president Joseph W. Mahaffee , a veteran of naval intelligence , is the leader of Booz Allen's
                 Maryland procurement office business , which puts him in charge of the company 's contracts with the NSA in
                 Fort Meade . He focuses on "meeting the Information Assurance mission objectives " of the NSA with various
                 technology services, including systems engineering , software development and "advanced telecommunications
                 analysis."

                 Another key Booz Allen figure at the NSA is Marty Hill, who came to the company after a 35-year career in
                 signals intelligence and electronic warfare and previously served as an expert on "information operations
                 capabilities and policy" for Donald Rumsfeld's Pentagon . He leads of team of 1,200 professionals engaged in
                 all aspects of "signals intelligence" including technical analysis , systems development and operations.

                 Vice President Pamela Lentz is a former cryptology officer with the Navy and once worked as a program
                 manager for TRW, one of the nation 's oldest intelligence contractors (it is now owned by Northrop Grumman).
                 She is Booz Allen's "client service officer " for the DIA and other military intelligence markets , which includes
                 intelligence units within the Navy , Air Force, Army, the unified combatant commands and the undersecretary of
                 defense for intelligence. Among other tasks , Lentz manages a 120-person Booz Allen team that supports the
                 NRO, the Pentagon agency that manages the nation 's military spy satellites . She also runs a task force that
                 supports human intelligence collection efforts at the DIA.

                 Vice President Laurene Gallo, a former intelligence analyst at the NSA , leads a Booz Allen "intelligence
                 research and analysis " team that support several agencies , including the CIA, the DNI and the National
                 Counterterrrorism Center . Vice President Richard Wilhelm , whose job at Booz Allen is to work with the CIA and
                 the ODNI , came to the company after a long career in U.S. intelligence that included stints directing the Joint
                 Intelligence Center for Iraq during Operation Desert Storm and the NSA 's first director of information warfare.

                 Vice President William Wansley , a former Army intelligence officer, leads a team of experts in "strategic and
                 business planning " who support the CIA's National Clandestine Service, the part of the CIA that conducts
                 covert operations and recruits foreign spies, as well as the DNI . Another vice president Robert W. Noonan, a
                 retired Army lieutenant general who once served as the Army 's deputy chief of staff for intelligence and the
                 commanding general of the U . S. Army's Intelligence and Security Command , is in charge of expanding Booz
                 Allen's military intelligence business within all the armed services , the combatant commands , the DIA and the
                 Office of the Secretary of Defense.

                 It is each of these vice presidents who are poised to personally profit from a corporate takeover by the Carlyle
                 Group.

                 Who is the Carlyle Group?

                 The Carlyle Group is a private equity fund - a group of financial advisers that invests large sums of money from
                 pension funds, large corporations, wealthy individuals and foreign banks into privately held companies in many
                 different industries, and then run those companies until the market is right to sell them at a substantial profit
                 During the early years of the George W. Bush administration , it gained attention - and some notoriety - because
                 of the large number of former high-ranking political figures it had attracted as advisers and managers. They
                 included former President George H.W. Bush , former Secretary of State James Baker and former British Prime
                 Minister John Major.

                Shortly after the September 11, 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington , Carlyle was in the news again
                when newspapers revealed that Osama Bin Laden's family in Saudi Arabia - which owns one of the world's

                  broke.

                  Until the recent slowdown in the financial markets , the private equity industry , with over $160 billion under its
                  control , was widely seen as one of the most important drivers of the global economy , pumping venture capital
                  into high-tech startups and buy-out capital into corporate reorganizations worldwide . They are extremely active

                  "Private equity funds now wield much of the transformational power at the heart of the capitalist system," The
                  Economist magazine recently observed . In addition to Carlyle , which has more than $75 billion under
                  management, industry leaders include the Blackstone Group ($30 billion ), Bain Capital ($27 billion), Kohlberg,
                  Kravis, Roberts & Co. ($26 billion) and Texas Pacific Group ($20 billion).

                  Carlyle, the largest of the funds , is best-known for owning large military contractors and aerospace contractors,
                  such as United Defense Industries , the maker of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and other weapons systems,
                  which it sold to BAE Systems in 2004 , and Vought Aircraft Industries , a major producer of structural assemblies
                  for commercial, military and business aircraft, which it still holds . Other military contractors that have gone
                  through Carlyle 's hands include EG&G , LTV Aerospace and Magnavox Electronic Systems.

                  During the 1990s , when it made most of these acquisitions , the fund was led by former Secretary of Defense
                  Frank Carlucci , who served during the Carter administration as deputy director of the CIA. During his tenure,
                  Carlyle bought and sold nearly a dozen companies active in the intelligence industry . They include BDM
                  International , an influential company that, during the 1990s , provided some of the U.S . Army's first contract
                  interpreters and, through a subsidiary known as Vinnell Corporation , once trained the Saudi National Guard. It
                  was eventually sold to Northrop Grumman and is now part of that company's huge intelligence division.

                  U.S. Investigative Service , which Carlyle bought in 1996 and sold in 2007, is the largest provider of security
                  investigations for employees and contractors hired by the Pentagon , the National Security Agency and other
                  agencies, and in recent months has been training Iraqi police commandoes under contract to the Pentagon.
                  (See CorpWatch coverage of USIS.)

                  Another spectacular acquisition was QinetiQ, the privatized arm of Britain's military research corporation. It was
                  acquired by Carlyle in 2003, sold in 2007, and recently emerged as one of the premiere U.S. intelligence
                  contractors - after netting a $470 million profit for Carlyle. (See our article "QinetiQ goes Kinetic".)

                 Carlyle, however, has divested itself of most of its military holdings. "In our current U.S. portfolio, there's none,"
                 Carlyle's Ullman told CorpWatch. Today, most of its investments are concentrated in commercial industries,
                 such as real estate and banking. During a few months' span in 2006, for instance, Carlyle did a "manufacturing
                 deal, an education deal, a consumer products deal, and buildings deal, and a financial services deal,"
                 according to an account in the Washingtonian magazine. Its holdings are extensive and pervasive: every time
                 you rent a car from Hertz, catch a quick breakfast at Dunkin' Donuts or get ice-cream at Baskin-Robbins, you're
                 sending money to Carlyle.

                 A $2 billion acquisition of Booz Allen's contracting business would therefore put Carlyle back in the big leagues
                 of military contractors.

                 Michael McConnell

                  Booz Allen Hamilton's most illustrious alumnus is Michael McConnell, the current Director of National
                  Intelligence, the top spy job in the country, who epitomizes the term revolving door, spinning from government
                 job to industry and back again.

                 McConnell was a senior Pentagon official during George Bush Senior's administration and the first Gulf War,
                 where he worked for Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of Defense, as the chief intelligence adviser to General
                 Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cheney was so impressed with McConnell's work during
                 the war that he appointed him to head the NSA in 1993 (he later intervened personally to convince McConnell
                 to take the DNI job in 2007).

                 McConnell subsequently spent more than 10 years as a Booz Allen senior vice president in charge of the
                 company' s extensive contracts in military intelligence and information operations for the Pentagon. In that job,
                 his official biography states , McConnell provided intelligence support to "the U . S. Unified Combatant
                 Commanders, the Director of National Intelligence Agencies , and the Military Service Intelligence Directors."
                 That made him a close colleague of not only Donald Rumsfeld , who ran the Pentagon from 2001 to 2007, but of
                 Vice President Cheney , who has served President Bush as a kind of intelligence godfather since the earliest
                 days of the administration.

                 As Booz Allen's chief intelligence liaison to the Pentagon , McConnell was at the center of action , both before
                 and after the September 11 attacks . During the first six years of the Bush administration , Booz Allen's contracts
                 with the U . S. government rose dramatically, from $626,000 in 2000 to $1.6 billion in 2006 . McConnell and his
                 staff at Booz Allen were deeply involved in some of the Bush administration 's most controversial
                 counterterrorism programs . They included the Pentagon 's infamous Total Information Awareness data-mining
                 scheme run by former Navy Admiral John Poindexter , which was an attempt to collect information on potential
                 terrorists in America from phone records, credit card receipts and other databases . (Congress cancelled the
                 program over civil liberties concerns , but much of the work was transferred to the NSA , where Booz Allen
                 continued to receive the contracts.)

                 In 2002 , when the CIA launched a financial intelligence project to track terrorist financing with the secret
                 cooperation of SWIFT, the Brussels-based international banking consortium , Booz Allen won a contract to
                 serve as an "outside" auditor of the project.

                 In January 2007 , McConnell resigned from Booz Allen after he was appointed by President George W. Bush to
                 his current job. He now oversees all 16 U . S. intelligence agencies , and thus much of Booz Allen 's government
                 business . (See this reporter's 2007 Salon article.)

                 Of Unions, Pension Funds and the Carlyle Group

                 The SEIU's campaign material on the Carlyle Group, including a 40-page white paper on private equity issued
                 last year, fails to mention a salient fact that many SEIU members are affiliated with a pension fund that holds a
                 significant stake in the Carlyle Group.

                 That fund is the California Public Employees Retirement System, the world's largest public pension fund, often
                 known as CaIPERS. It has held a five percent stake in Carlyle's core management group since 2000, and
                 therefore profits every time Carlyle makes money from one of its investments. Many of the California state
                 officials who sit on CaIPERS boards are also members of the SEIU, although they officially only represent their
                 employer, not the union.

                 In 2001 , this reporter attended a meeting of the CaIPERS investment board where Carlyle's three founding
                 managers appeared as witnesses . The public meeting took place at a time when Carlyle was a hot media topic
                 because of its close ties to the Bush administration and its prominence as the nation 's 11th largest military
                 contractor. Several SEIU officials attended the meeting , and the questioning of Carlyle was led by a CaIPERS
                 official who belonged to the SEIU . However, the investment board didn't ask about Carlyle 's military industry
                 investments , and instead posed a single , softball question about Carlyle 's views on the U.S. investment climate.

                 Asked why the SEIU hasn't mentioned CaIPERS' stake in Carlyle in any of its literature , Stephen Lerner, the
                 director of SEIU's Private Equity Project , replied that the union didn't start investigating the pension fund's role
                 in Carlyle until 2007.

                 Until then, "we never really thought about CaIPERS ' investment in Carlyle ," he said . " Now that we're digging in
                 deeper, we're raising lots of questions." Under SEIU's initiative, a California lawmaker has introduced legislation
                 that would prohibit CaIPERS from investing in private equity funds owned in part by overseas funds from
                 countries that don't "generally respect human rights ." According to an SEIU handout , the legislation "is only
                 applicable to private equity firms in which sovereign wealth funds have an ownership stake ," such as Carlyle.

                 Carlyle's Ullman responded that the legislation could hurt the people it is supposed to protect . California
                 lawmakers "should consider the detrimental impact on California pensioners who have benefited greatly from
                 CaIPERS ' investment in, and ownership of, the Carlyle Group ," he told CorpWatch.
