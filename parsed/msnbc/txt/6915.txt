             Might I suggest that you box some of those bottles. Governor ( Erika can still remove all of than right now) and we
             tape you doing so while also speaking to the message. It is a great idea for a psa and shows that ultimately life, its
             actions, and consequences are about personal responsibility.

             Erika - would have the Govs Mansion's alcohol that's in the liquor cabinet boxed up and removed from "the People's
             House" downstairs in the public dining area? Here's my thinking: with so many kids and teens coming and going in
             that house, esp during this season of celebrationstt for young people - proms, graduations, etc, I want to send the
             msg that we can be - and "the People's House" needs to be - alcohol-free. There's a lot of booze there - its too
             accessible and may be too tempting to any number of all those teens coming and going.

             We need to send this sobriety msg. It can be sent via support from Native Sobriety Assns, M. A. D. D. , Healthcare
             Strategies Council, or whomever can also benefit from the vocal support that I can provide them through this action,
             then I'll do it.
