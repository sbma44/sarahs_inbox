               Governor,

               FYI, here is an update on the CP spill at Kuparak as of this morning .                    At that time they
               were estimating the spill at 102bbls.

              0710 Update

              James Short,      C-P Environmental Engineer returned my phone calls.

              The pipeline is a well flow commonline , carrying the flow from wells on the 2U and 2W well
              pads , from the well pads to the Central Processing Facility #2 (CPF#2 ) at Kuparuk. It is
              part of the production gathering system , and not a DOT regulated pipeline.




              Leak was discovered at 0133 in the morning of Sunday 12/16 / 2007 . Line was shut in
              immediately , but required until around noon to depressure and the hazardous atmosphere
              around the leak to disperse , to allow access and evaluation .  Environmental were
              monitoring explosive limits , benzene and H2S, until levels reached safe limits to allow
              access to the area.




              Leak is from an 8 inch split in the pipeline , at the 8 o ' clock position . The CPF#2 was
              having upset conditions , and operations personnel suspect a surge may have been initiated,
              causing the rupture . Preliminary estimates of spill are 102 bbls.


                                                                2




                                                                                                              PRA GSPO1_0008613
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com         Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




              The rupture occurred in an area with no access road .  An ice road is being constructed to
              site . The primary spill response company , Alaska Clean Seas ( 7 personnel ) is on site,
              along with 15 contract workers and 12 Conoco Phillips responders .   An additional 15
              contract clean up workers are in transit .  Estimate 50 to 60 personnel will be on site
              working on response today.



              The rupture site has been cleaned, and the insulation has been removed, preparing the site
              for a sleeve. Inspection crews will access shortly.



              Plan for clean up is to remove as much contaminated snow as possible. Once contaminated
              snow is removed, they will proceed with hot water washes to remove oil from frozen tundra.



             Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), Wes Ghormley arrived at site
             yesterday and is on site today.



              James Short will follow up with pressure and flowrate of the pipeline , and developments
              through the day.



             Larry Disbrow




             I've got a call in to James Short at Conoco Phillips Environmental, Kuparuk, and am
             awaiting his return call.



             From the description, the line that leaked is a common line, meaning the combined flow of
             a number of wells, flowing with 3 phase flow, from the well site, to the Central
             Processing Facilities (CPF).




             I will post a follow up,     as soon as I can gather more information.
