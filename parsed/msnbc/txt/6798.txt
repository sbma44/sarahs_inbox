               The MHTA panel sent forward one name (Dr. Burgess of Homer).
               The panel sent the name after the deadline to submit names to the Legislature for confirmation. Also,
               they only sent one name for consideration.

               We were considering privileg or this board , but she will serve on the Health Council instead . We have
               no other serious candidates at this time.

               The MHTA can still have quorum at board meetings with the current members whether we act now or
               make an interim appointment.
               I'll touch base with Mike and get this figured out before the weekend is over . I'll get a list of good
               candidates together for you to consider next week.

               where are we in the choice process - who are the candidates? we need to hustle on this one too.

               I'd rather hustle with a selection versus invite him to call and discuss it further... I'm sure there's
               someone they can agree to?

                I understand your concern . We haven 't made any final decisions on the MHTA appointment.
                Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.

                Thank you,

                Hi Ivy,

                I'm sure you are extremely busy but my Board is getting concerned about the appointment of a
                new Trustee to replace John Malone whose term expired on March 3rd and who is term limited
                out from continuing to serve.

                As you know, current Trustees serve until a new Trustee is appointed and confirmed therefore
                an interim appointment will not give us a new Trustee.

                Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist you.

                Thanks!

                Jeff
