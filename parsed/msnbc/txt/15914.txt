            Governor - I just received an email from Marty Rutherford asking if she could meet with
            you today for 30 minutes regarding AGIA messaging during the Special Session. This
            meeting would be between Marty, Kurt Gibson and Meg Stapleton(on phone). Marty is not
            presenting so would be available to your schedule. Janice
