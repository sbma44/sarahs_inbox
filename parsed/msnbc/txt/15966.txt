         Hello everyone... pardon me for this late entry. I see that there were some emails I
         wasn't included in and so perhaps this next question was already addressed: Privileged orPer
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           Thanks for everyone 's flexibility and quick set-up - and a Copper River King, too!



           Thanks,

           rough count is 22 ppl. We could do it tonight at b:JU or b:00

            Tonight's great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and
          still be successful . There's a Costco in Juneau , if you know what I mean. And my family is
          quite capable of setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

            Great idea ! Please all decide what is best for AGIA .  But if time doesn 't matter
          tonight is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.
          Again decide what is best for AGIA. Tom

          opportunity tonight , tomorrow , or wednesday . I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good
