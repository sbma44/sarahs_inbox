              Dear Governor Palin:

              Mrs. Palin, I just wanted to express my thanks to you for your support of our
              military and the Global War On Terrorism. I'm proud to say that I'm a resident of
              Alaska with you in office, showing your support for us and our mission to defeat Al
              Qeada in Iraq. I currently work (he is in my unit) with your son in 1/25 SECT (Ft.
              Wainwright) and I' m sure he is extremely proud of how you represent us and show the
              support for the War in Iraq.
              Again, thank you for all that you do as Governor of our Incredible state of Alaska.

              God Bless,


              CW2 William "Chip" Steele
