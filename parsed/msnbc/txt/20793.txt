               Don't we have a state demographer? If so, we could refer the question to him/her. If not, we could respond with a
               polite note explaining that we're swamped and have little time for this kind of research.

               Just a few. Most things are clearly not for the Governor 's office. Inquiries like this, however, are
               fuzzier, and I'm not sure how to categorize them.

               Press inquiries are one thing . Random questions by random people all over the country is another . I don't know
               that we have time to do the latter. How many random questions like this are we receiving?

              I'm concerned about a clearinghouse for these kinds of questions . I imagine Sharon 's been dealing
              with numerous inquiries of this kind and should possibly be Involved with any response sent by our
              office - but I don 't know if we've established a policy on this . Rosanne, what do you think?

                         your interview

                   Governor has declined First Family per diem reimbursements to date of $4,461
                   State of Alaska rented an apartment in Anchorage for Governor Murkowski
                   Governor Knowles accepted per diem while in Anchorage
                   Per diem is NOT taxable
                   Governor MurkowskVs travel in 2006 totaled $ 525,392
                   Governor Palin dismissed chef for mansion chef / OT/ Temp savings                       $97,000 -
                    for 2007
                   Annual savings in house expenses (food and supplies for the mansion ) = $96,000 -
                      for 2007
                     Reduction in security detail down from 7 - 2 = $125,000 in savings for 2007
                   Governor Palin does not travel with an entourage
                   King Air has NOT been available most of this year - down for maintenance,
                     painting, etc.
                    Governor Palin prefers to drive herself - no chauffeur



               Ms. Garnero,
                     I'm writing with a few technical questions regarding the per diem
               paid to Gov. Palin for nights she spent in her Wasilla residence between
               Dec. 4, 200.6 and June 30, 2008:
                     1)   Is the per diem she received the same type paid to state
               employees for the purpose of covering lodging/meals/incidentals incurred
               while working away from home on state business? Is there any other purpose
               for the per diem received by the governor?
                    2) Does the state consider the per diem paid to the governor to be
               taxable income?

               Thanks in advance for your help.

               1)  Yes, our travel policies provides for a meals and incidentals (M&IE) allowance
               when on travel status as follows:

               If a traveler maintains a dwelling at their destination and it is available to
               them, they will be entitled to only an M&IE allowance for normal workdays. An M&IE
               allowance for other than normal workdays is not allowed. (excerpt from the Alaska
               Administrative Manual 60.250)

               I am aware of no other purpose for the per diem paid to the governor.

                2)  No, our travel policies follow the IRS requirements for accountable plans.
                M&IE allowances that are below the federal rates are not taxable as long as the
              . traveler working outside their duty station.
