               MESSAGE:
               I heard on the news that you were considering endorsing Senator McCain but you were
               going to talk to McCain and Huckaby first. I don't feel that you should limit your
               conversation to McCain and Huckelby    Romney should be considered as well. I
               think that he is one of the best candidates. He holds very strong convictions in
               the various topics of discussion. The Economy, National Security, Immigration, I
               really don't like the way people media has been portraying him to be non Christian
               and when you think of the title of President he resemble a President. His
               background is clean and he shows dedication to his sense of Family. Which is what
               America is all about; protecting and preserving our great land for our future
               generation to be raised in a safe and strong country. He displays a strong sense
               of Integrity, Knowledge and willingness to work with both sides for the improvement
               of our Country.
