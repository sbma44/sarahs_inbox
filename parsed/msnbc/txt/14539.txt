           Governor Sarah Palin

           Office of the Governor

           Juneau, AK 99811-0001




           Dear Governor Palin,




           I'm writing to thank you for your efforts to increase funding

           for Head Start education this year. As you clearly know,

          providing high-quality early childhood education benefits our

           children and increases their chances of future success.
                                                                1

           Supporting state-funded Head Start is a commitment to our

           children and an investment in our economic prosperity, and we

           cannot afford to pass up these opportunities.



           Thank you again for your leadership on this important issue. I

           hope Head Start in our state can continue to count on your

           support in the future. Our children' s future demands nothing

           less.



           Sincerely,




           Thank you,

           Mark Lackey

                Chamber Defeats Bill to Increase Pay Discrimination Lawsuits
                In a significant legislative victory , the U.S . Chamber helped block efforts to
                expand federal discrimination laws. By a vote of 56 -42, the Senate rejected
                the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which would have overturned a Supreme Court
                decision restricting compensation discrimination claims that are filed many
                years after the alleged act.
