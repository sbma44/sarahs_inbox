E- when's a home football game for JDHS? Maybe the travel date(s) would coincide with catching a
game. The girls and I, anyway, could stay over long enough to catch one if Todd and Track have to
get back after photos.

Tib- anyone know when the king air has to return from servicing? I assume it has to fly thru
Anchorage? If so, maybe that's a good way to get my family down here for First Family events incl
the official family photos (which a year later we still haven't done), the mansion Christmas photo
shoot (Erika's on it - she'll put wreaths on the door or fireplace and we'll call it good... Maybe outdoor
shot with wreath on exterior), the Alaska Magazine photos with family in Juneau, etc. Otherwise, we
need commercial reservations soon.



The sooner the better on the christmas pics! My kids are getting busier than ever and it will be
impossible to have everyone together if it's not in the next couple of weeks - just for the day is good
enough. Do you want Kris to help me on this one?



Todd- what date 's good for you? I can take the kids out of school if need be. Either king air or
commercial...
