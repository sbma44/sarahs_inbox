  Good morning Governor;

  I was hoping to spend a few minutes with you while in Juneau but I know how your schedule fills and
  changes! Anyway just in case I miss out I thought I would send a quick note. I am sure you are well
  aware that I have accepted another assignment in Soldotna with the wildlife troopers, this will be
  something new for me and hopefully will offer some new challenges and re-wards. I have truly enjoyed
  getting to know you and your family and will miss some aspects of this assignment; even though I won't
  be around every day I will count on working with you in the future as I will be flying the King Air on a part
  time basis. I know you are busy so I will keep this short but please keep me in mind if you ever need
  anything and/or are in the Soldotna area, it would be my pleasure to help in anyway I can. I will
  remember you in my prayers and if you ever need input or some confident place to vent I would consider
  it an honor!

  I depart on the 23rd, and not sure if my phone number will change but I will let you know if it does.

  Always at your service
  Shane
