              Subject: Gravina
             If the opportunity may come up to make one of these points:
             The delegation has commented about funds "they worked so hard to secure."
             Two thirds (66%) of those funds earmarked for the Gravina Bridge were formula funds
             that would have come to the state regardless ($148 million of the $223 million in
             Gravina earmarks)
             For Ketchikan to say they worked hard to secure those funds is partially correct -
             however most of those funds would have come to Alaska regardless, the earmark
             designated they be used on the Gravina bridge

             It is an important point that most of the earmarks for the bridges were formula funds, not
             additional funds above the formula amounts we receive
                   Two thirds (66%) of those funds earmarked for the Gravina Bridge were formula
                     funds
                   As a comparison, 78% of the Knik earmarks were formula funds ($179 million of
                     the $229 million in Knik earmarks)
                   In November 2005, congress stripped the requirement that the money be used for
                     either bridge project, letting the state spend it as we found appropriate (within our
                     statutes and regulations)
                   The funds that were subsequently returned back to the bridges ($93 for Knik and
                     $71 for Gravina) are designated for National Highway System projects (NHS), and
                     the department (and therefore the Governor) has considerable discretion in
                     deciding on which protects those funds will be used.

             To let the Gravina funds sit in a project that has no hope of getting full funding to
             construct when they could be put to use on other needed projects is not responsible
