           Sounds great I believe I'll need it just for me- unless AGIA can now utilize this new one-
           day arrangement too, with me. Thanks

           Governor - There is a limited number of seats available on the evening of Monday, June 30
           Barrow - ANC (Return).




           Departing Barrow at 8:01 p.m. Arrive ANC at 11:00 p.m. I              can hold seats on the return and
           we will work on the June 30 morning flight - this way you              would only be in Barrow for one
           day (Monday, June 30). How many seats would you need for              this day. I know some gasline
           members will be in Barrow but would you like other staff              to also accompany you. Janice

           There is no open flight showing the night of June 30 online - but am checking with others
           to make sure there is not an open seat on this date . I will have an answer to you by
           morning.  Janice
