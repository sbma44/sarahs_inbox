               Thanks. I had let him know it was all taken care of also. I told him he didn't need to fly
               in early to pick us up- we'd find a ride.

                    Done deal.  Talked with Gary this morning. Dan Rohrer will pick us up, take us to
              the debate, then drop us back off immediately after. You've met Dan at Kodiak Chamber of
              commerce and his parents Dick and Sue Rohrer, good solid small business owner-no
              controversy.

                             Frank- if u can find someone already in Kodiak to pick us up at airport (or
              we could take a cab ), let me know so security doesn't have to travel early in order to get
              us to the school for the two-hr event ... I talked to Gary about t        is morning.
              Thanks . It'll be a ride for the four of us, a neutral person not PriVlle or anyone too
              controversial to pick us up. Thanks!
