             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,



             I am a Christian, wife of a retired military officer, Mom, former public school teacher &
             currently home school our three children. I have been a resident of MN, ND, AZ, & NY.    I
             KNOW firsthand the effects of illegal immigrants on safety (I was almost assaulted by
             illegal farm workers while I was in college), had them try to break into my house in AZ,
             saw them overrun the schools & clinics in AZ. I also saw what BIG government did to nice
             places in upstate NY. Please tell me that you do not support John McCain & his amnesty
             ways.  It is anti-American that we as Christians cannot be heard because of
             McCain/Feingold prior to elections when such matters need to be fresh in people's minds.
             Huckabee may have been a pastor, but he certainly does not seem to be conservative either
             in many ways. Yet, the news reports you as saying you would like to speak to McCain &
             Huckabee, what about Mitt Romney? Though I do not see eye to eye w/ Romney on everything
             including his religious affiliati

             on, but he is pro-life & he is strong on immigration & the economy. The most CONSERVATIVE
             candidate still in the race. I wish the others were as concerned about reaching the
             conservatives in their party as they are about embracing the democrat agenda. I hope you
             read this as well as the attached link & I would appreciate a repsonse.



             Sincerely,   Karen Bembenek
