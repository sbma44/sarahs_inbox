          I'll look at, but it does need to be submitted today as it'll take a few days to get
          published

         When was the op ed submitted?



         Pls let me know of today's opportunities to communicate back to Hollis and other leggies,
         and the public, that there's no gag order. We need to make sure we don't preach to the
         choir (internally) on this, but that allegations are dealt with in a truthful and public
         manner - again, be Hollis is so public (as have been a few other leggies) in their
         assumptions that ACES is causing friction within.


                                                                  1

          No doubt I'll be speaking to more reporters today - we could be proactive and get a msg
          out there before I'm asked to merely react again.

         pat's op-ed which was next in line would be the most obvious place to address. I'll work
         with the team on this. Also in the other info we are developing and sharon can get anyone
         doing radio, tv and print interviews to keep this message at the forefront.

         Still trying to sit down with it- I have to today in between mtgs.



         Pis be thinking how to message back to Hollis who is insisting he knows there is internal
         dissent on ACES . Part of the response is: he needs to provide specifics as his allegations
         are political and unfair unless he names names so I can deal with this issue - if there is
         an issue . If there isnt he needs to quit stirring up doubts and just deal with ACES on its
         merits. There is no gag order and I hope staff will publicly debate this.



         I hate the politics in this, as ACES is too imp to be messing around with and I don't want
         anyone holding back if they have disagreements with the proposal.



         But please dont let anyone talk you into just letting this slide, and go unanswered. We do
         too much of that and then we have to "react" aggressively and try to unring a bell that
         critics have rung. Let's get on top of this one and I've asked Russ to call Hollis this
         morning , but Hollis has been so public about this the past few days we owe it to the
         public to answer Hollis' accusations.
