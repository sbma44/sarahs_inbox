            Hi Sarah and Todd: What better family could the Lord have sent Trig to!!! We have known
            you Todd, and your parents, since you were a boy in school in Glennallen. Your dad Jim
            has always been Katy's favorite coach. Sarah, we tease our son. Robbie that he showered
            with the Governor of Alaska. You probably remember.the baby boy who helped to chaperon
            your basketball team.  We know, respect and love you all. Hold your special son in your
            hearts and he'll grow to be a marvelous, loving human being. Just as all his family
            members are.



            Best wishes and God's blessings to you .... from the Port Family. Rollie and Carol
