                  Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at
            public safety.



                  It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had
            uncovered a memo from the City of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when
            the allegation/complaint came into the department the city removed Chuck from all
            supervisory duties. They made it quite sinister as you can expect like there is still
            something that he and the city was hiding.



                   I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could
            walk through this with me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on
            the phone with the City of Kenai attorney's office working on a strategy.



                  The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human
            resource response when you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it
            relates to sexual harassment, you remove immediately the person from the any of
            supervisory duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this woman) until you can
            substantiate or unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the
            claim and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.



                  Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public
            with what he can and set the record straight. He will have the city Mayor bhis side and
            she will attest to the situation in favor of Chuck. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


                  That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he
            will call me in the. morning with some more follow up.

                  My understanding , just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney
            and is going to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a
            kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are any details I
            need to hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.

                     He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap.
            I've had very good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
