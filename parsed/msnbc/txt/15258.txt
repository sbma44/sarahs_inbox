          Dear Ivy,

            I respectfully request Governor Palin to consider writing a letter of support for Governor
            Mike Stepovich's nomination for an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska
            Fairbanks. Since we will be in the middle of celebrating our 50th anniversary of statehood
            next year, it would be wonderful to have Governor Stepovich receive this honorary degree
            during this time period.




            I am attaching my letter of nomination as background.




            The nominating committee will be meeting on May 25th, so time is of the essence here. The
            letter should be sent to:




            HDR Nominating Committee
