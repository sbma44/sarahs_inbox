              I am not been informed of an Alexander Creek mtg. I'll ask Joe if there is progress on
              this issue regarding any meeting, but I have not been in the loop on it and Young's office
              hasn't told/asked me anything about it - so I'm.in the dark on any details. In fact, I
              know about this issue via this email exchange, I haven't had meetings on it.



             Who would I even be meeting with? The community of Skwetna? Does Alexander Creek have an
             organized government or Native Corp representing the area?

             Todd and I are partners with other families in a recreation cabin on Alexander Creek, as
             is disclosed in my APOC reports, fyi.

                     PRIVILEGE




             It is our understanding that you may soon be meeting with representatives of Alexander
             Creek.  On Friday, we learned that there might be a House hearing on November 14th on
             legislation proposed by Alexander Creek to grant them additional lands in the Mat-Su
             Valley.



             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             With all of this in mind, and not knowing whether you ever saw my previous email on the
             Alexander Creek bill, I have attached my earlier email analyzing this legislation and
             suggesting how we might approach it, at least for the time being.




                                                                1
