          Sharon- I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault's taking out PSIO positions and BP corrosion
          lawsuit funds out of my budget. Im back here in DC speaking with Cneney (sat with him the
          entire state dinner last night), will try to speak w/Bush today... speaking with national
          reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide sound oversight
          of resource development , as evidenced by PSIO, lawsuits to hold industry ' s feet to the
          fire re: waste of valuable natural resources, etc... and here while I'm away I find out
          the legislature may undermine those efforts? It's unacceptable if the nation is to
          believe we're capable of responsible, ethcial ramped up development that's need in our
          state, for our nation.
