            Good Morning Ma'am,

           Thank you so much for making an appearance at DMV training day, I know the staff member were thrilled
           that you'd take the time to stop in and say 'hi'!

           The State of Alaska is fortunate to have both a Governor and a DMV family that strives to make things
           just a little 'bit better each day for our residents.

           Thank you again,

           Duane Bannock
           Director
           Division of Motor Vehicles

             Stat Alert - October 4, 2007
            A report from the U.S. Census Bureau, Reasons People Do Not Work: 2004
            (http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p70-111.pdf/), includes an interesting analysis
            comparing race/ethnicity and educational attainment levels with reasons nonworkers
            cited for not working. In particular, workers with higher educational attainment levels
            were much less likely to cite "Unable to find work" and "Chronic illness/disability"
            and more likely to cite "Retired" as reasons for not working than people with lower
            educational attainment levels. The report also analyzes the data by race/ethnicity.
