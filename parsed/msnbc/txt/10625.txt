              Governor :

              Thank you for the compliment. I will miss serving on RurAL CAP, but it's time for Rhonda
              to bring a new perspective and voice from your office. I hope you and your family are
              enjoying Christmas together (don't know if your husband's work schedule allows him to be
              with you today) and that God continues to bless you with wisdom and good counsel in the
              coming year.

              ak

              Not an urgent e-mail . But some insights into the value of the work that we do , that are
              not always in the job description.



              During my first week on the job, Commissioner Annette Kreitzer did some mentoring, as she
              handed off her duties to me as the governor ' s representative on the RurAL CAP Board.



              It's clear this non - profit agency is appreciative of Commissioner Kreitzer ' s five years of
              service on the board.



              For one thing, she has a reputation for doing her homework . Board members talked about how
              she scrutinized the voluminous board packets - something that very few board members
              actually do.   But they know Commissioner Kreitzer did, because she asked lots of tough
              questions .  questions that weren ' t always well received at first , but in the end helped
              the organization better meet its challenges.



               It struck me that this has taken a lot of courage on Commissioner Kreitzer ' s part.   Since
               most non - profits are formed to provide a community service , there's a tendency for those
               who run these organizations to look past the bottom line questions - often to the non-
             . profit's detriment.



              From child development programs to energy , RurAL CAP is growing concern - a $25 million a
              year corporation .  And Kreitzer ' s expertise in budget and finance came at an important
              time.

                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0008965

               Commissioner Kreitzer served on two nuts - and-bolts committees :      the Audit Committee and
               the Administration and Finance Committee.



               During recent committee meetings , I had a chance to observe her in action .           She often
               emphasized the importance of accountability and measuring outcomes.



               A telling moment came in the discussion of RurAL CAP ' s vision statement - which included
               the goal of " Environmental Action ."  Commissioner Kreitzer questioned whether this was in
               line with RurAL CAP ' s mission to address poverty . At the Commissioner ' s suggestion, board
               members changed the language to "Community Improvement " - a goal that is not only more
               accurate , but less politically inflammatory - perhaps heading off future opposition to
               RurAL CAP programs .   Many of RurAL CAPS programs deal with recycling and solid wastes -
               but are mostly used as a vehicle to grow village leaders - so to head them under
               " environmental action " is not nearly as comprehensive.




               When the board officially thanked Commissioner Kreitzer, they teased her about her
               aversion to "group hugs. But you could sense from the people in the room, they would miss
               her dedication -- and occasional contrarian voice. There was acknowledgement that she
               served the greater good by raising good questions.



               From energy to tribal government to subsistence , the state will wrestle with some
               difficult rural issues in the year ahead - and RurAL CAP will be an important resource to
               tap.



              I look forward to serving on the board , appreciative that Commissioner Kreitzer has laid a
              good foundation for me .  As I shadowed her, she took time to explain the dynamics of the
              board - and gave me pointers on how to conduct myself.



              The RurAL CAP board is made up of Native leaders from across the state , and the care and
              professionalism that she took in making her transition off the board , put the Palin
              administration in a positive light.



              It was nothing short of classy .   And there ' s no doubt , Commissioner Kreitzer will be a
              tough act to follow.
