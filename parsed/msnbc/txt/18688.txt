             Governor, Newsweek and Sharon land at 9:40 a.m. today. They should be to the office by
             approximately 10:30.  I will reconfirm with Sharon. Thanks, Janice

            What time is the AO signing on Climate Change today? We'll need to let AP and other
            outlets know so Quinn can be there - there are lots of Alaskans waiting to hear what we're
            doing on Climate... this is a very good visual and public "first step" they've been
            waiting for. We know we've been working on it, but Alaskans don't know that yet. Thanks
