              I believe that Senator McCain has been supportive of, or at least not opposed to, the
              natural gas pipeline. He might be willing to say some good things about the state's
              efforts to commercialize North Slope natural gas, with the related national interest
              implications. That would be great but, of course, not a quid pro quo for his
              opposition to oil development in ANWR.

                 That would be great. Kris Perry can help on my end with scheduling a time.

                 The Senator indicated to me that he wants to spend as much one on one time as
                 possible discussing issues with Governors this weekend. If you like, I'm happy to
                 set this up.

                 And is there any possibility I could hear from McCain on Alaska ' s resource
                 development issues? (ie. why is he opposed to ANWR oil drilling , why is he
                 hooked up with Lieberman on a few anti-development initiatives?)

                 If anyone can help me hear from him on that, our state would appreciate it. I'll
                 have a tough time explaining my support for him until I can say I spoke with him
                 about my concerns re: any pro -environmental stands he's taking that could hurt
                 Alaska.

                 Governors,

                  I'm looking forward to seeing many of you this weekend. I know how tightly
                 these weekends are scheduled , but I wanted to make sure all of you were aware
                 of a gracious invitation we just received from John McCain . He is hosting a
                 governors and spouses only reception at the Willard prior to the Statesman
                 dinner on Saturday night where he is our special guest . I know your RGA
                 briefings have already gone out, which is why I wanted to personally highlight
                 this addition and ask you to attend . The reception will be at 6:15pm. I'll be sure
                 RGA gets your schedulers more information on this.

                  The other ask I have of you is to stay in Washington for the Gala on Monday
                 night. It is President Bush 's last RGA dinner and we will all be sitting on the
                 stage as he delivers his remarks . Over the years the President has been , a great
                 friend to RGA and he was active as a governor so I want to make sure we are all
                 there to express our appreciation to him. Another important reason we need you
                 to attend is this is our biggest fundraiser of the year for RGA.

                   I hope you will consider these two requests . See you soon.

                   Rick
