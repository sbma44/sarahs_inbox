          Governor -




          I just faxed up one of the copies of the letter on the phone wire. Both letters were the
          same, just addressed to different support staff.




         Here is the attached MOU. I will also cut and paste into the body of this email in case
         in won't open on the blackberry. I have listed it on your calendar as FYI just in case
         you do decide to stop by for it. Thank you, Janice
