         Governor, do you know how loved you are? These four or five bitter people are so NOT
         representative. You are so, so loved. The enemy is trying to discourage you. Hang I there!
         You are doing such an awesome job. You are an amazing lady and the Lord is your defender.
         He knows the truth and He is going to vindicate you. It hurts my heart to hear these
         horrible people are bringing you down. We forgive them, Lord. Help theses people come to
         know You.

         Guys, I may be pretty wimpy about this family stuff, but I feel like I'm at the breaking
         point with the hurtful gossip about my family that Sherry and others get away with. Bear
         with me. I hate this part of the job and many days I feel like it's not worth it when they
         have to put up with the hate that, spews from people like Sherry, and there are others.

         Below is the email Don sent to ADN. It's not much, but we were trying to bring there
         attention to this ongoing and very frustrating situation. Her comments are downright
         libelous.  You're right-she's a crazy hater.

                 Hey,




                 Cut the body of this email and paste into a new email and send to content@adn.com.




                 Dear Sir or Madam,




                 I'm writing to bring your attention to the increasingly inapropriate comments posted
          by the blogger syrin .  Every day she posts comments that have absolutely no bearing on
          policy.   For example, today the ADN posted a positive story on the national press Governor
          Palin is receiving , yet syrin accuses the governor of having an affair or makes hateful
          comments about her young children. I don't often feel compelled to write, but syrin's
          comments are never on topic , nor are they civil as is stated in the terms of use.




                 Thank you for your time.




                                                            2

             Remind him of the family travels w me that I have personally pd for, including with mileage.
             Hopefully our records very clearly show that. Also, my return of every per diem offer for
             everything related to the kids...and we need to be proactive in this issue with reminding him of
             all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage apartment ...no chef... security down
             from 7 to 2, whatever- I'm sorry you have to deal w this w the FOIA even, I know I'm tired of it
             already. It is important to know though that probably a week doesn't go by without me asking if
             all the rules are being followed, if the Palin family is doing everything right with our travel, etc
             as First Family:
             Another significant thing here, to. me anyway, was the exclusion of my 17-yr old son (now 19)
             from all but two First Family events (he traveled to Juneau twice is all in these two yrs and I
             think I ended up paying for one of the trips myself), I was told it was because he wasn't going to
             school in Juneau, which never made much sense to me but I didn't argue the fact he is a member
             of the family too.
             Pls show the travels of the previous Govs so he can compare- inci the fact previous Govs took
             family vacations WITH our security guys so they could take advantage of their rental cars, etc
             (this is according to Bob and Gary), compare that to me never having done this.
             We have to be proactive on this so pls let me know if you need any further info.

             I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially was looking for a , copy of
             the 2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft . He had located the opinion online just as I called
             back. He then said he was looking into the question of when a governor 's family could travel at state expense
             and asked whether there was any other opinion on this issue . I advised generally that a family member might
             travel at state expense if the member was to attend an official function (he said for example the inauguration), and
             that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this point

             He then wanted to know whether there was a statute, regulation or other guidance defining what would be an
             official function or state business. I advised that I was not aware of any . It would likely depend on the
             circumstance and the involved official's authority. He also asked who would decide and I suggested again it
             would likely be addressed in the circumstances on a case by case basis by the governor 's office.

             would likely be addressed in the circumstances on a case by case basis by the governor's office.

            He did not say or suggest whether he is looking at the question with respect to Governor Palin or a former
            governor.

              I imagine we will be pressed by media outlets for a response. Is there anything in particular you would like to convey? I
             think the story is going to be overshadowed, but we likely can't ignore it. Short and sweet ought to do.

             Hopefully we can provide information in being proactive to show what other Governor's travel has been and
             w/family. Remember that story not long ago that compared and showed the large difference between Palin and
             Murkowski? This is so ridiculus. We're talking about a Governor who had the state buy tickets on hotwire saving
             hundreds of dollars rather than just going w/the norm (much more expensive) or the fact that she often drives to the
             Peninsula or Fairbanks or the fact that her family rarely travels w/her when most of the invitations are for first
             family. Not to mention the majority of the time she flies commercial (and not first class!!)

             Remind him of the family travels w me that I have personally pd for, including with mileage. Hopefully our records
             very clearly show that. Also, my return of every per diem offer for everything related to the kids-and we need to be
             proactive in this issue with reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage
             apartment...no chef... security down from 7 to 2, whatever- Fm sorry you have to deal w this w the FOIA even, I
             know I'm tired of it already. It is important to know though that probably a week doesn't go by without me asking if
             all the rules are being followed, if the Palin family is doing everything right with our travel, etc as First Family.
             Another significant thing here, to me anyway, was the exclusion of my 17-yr old son (now 19) from all but two First
             Family events (he traveled to Juneau twice is all in these two yrs and I think I ended up paying for one of the trips
             myself), I was told it was because he wasn't going to school in Juneau, which never made much sense to me but I
             didn't argue the fact be is a member of the family too.
             Pls show the travels of the previous Govs so he can compare- incl the fact previous Govs took family vacations
             WITH our security guys so they could take advantage of their rental cars, etc (this is according to Bob and Gary),
             compare that to me never having done this.
             We have to be proactive on this so pls let me know if you need any further info.

              Linda Perez and I both spoke with Kyle today. He has filed a public records request for all of your travel and your family's
              travel. He is really digging into the travel regs. He wants to know where it is spelled out where/when a family member can
              travel. I told him AGAIN that there is a certain expectation that the First Family make public appearances and participate in
              community activities as part of protocol. I am blue in the face with this guy! I told him that the Governor receives on
              average 200 requests each month and more than half extend the invitation to the First Family . I also reminded him that you
              prefer to travel by car and the kids aren't always with you. Somehow I don't think that will make it in the paper.

              hope nothing is written that we have to react to , based on adn having misinformation or not enough info.
              BTW, this trip I'm taking to NGA with family is being paid by NGA because it's some annual family-invitation event for the

             Dear Governor Palin,

                 I just spoke with Mr. Nizich after I forwarded this to him. Hesaid I should go ahead and let you know directly. He says
             your office has also received phone inquiries on travel in the last 24 hours from the ADN as well. This is just to give you a
             fuller picture of what may be happening in the news world. Talis

             CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

             I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially was looking for a copy of the
             2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft. He had located the opinion online just as I called back. He then said
             he was looking into the question of when a governor ' s family could travel at state expense and asked whether there was any
             other opinion on this issue. I advised generally that a family member might travel at state expense if the member was to
             attend an official function (he said for example the inauguration), and that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this
             point.

             He then wanted to know whether there was a statute, regulation or other guidance defining what would be an official function
             or state business. I advised that I was not aware of any. It would likely depend on the circumstance and the involved
