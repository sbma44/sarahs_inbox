             I googled and found a Dittman poll for Murk in August 2006 referenced on Kyle's
             blog.

             Dave Dittman, the longtime Anchorage pollster who worked on Murkowski' s campaign
             earlier in the race, finished a poll on the Republican primary last night.

             He says he surveyed people who are eligible to vote on the Republican ballot and
             voted in the party's primary in 2004. (Except for a fraction - 7 percent - who have
             registered since 2004 and say they'll vote Aug. 22).

             Dittman says he didn't conduct the poll for any particular candidate and that the
             sample size is about 500 people. His results are similar to the recent Rasmussen
             Reports numbers:

             Palin: 40 percent
             Binkley: 29 percent
             Murkowski: 17 percent

             Dittman writes: "Fourteen percent (14%) are still undecided with a week remaining
             before the election, however a demographic analysis of the undecided voters
             estimates that if the election were held today, Palin would receive 46%, Binkley
             34% and Murkowski 20%.
