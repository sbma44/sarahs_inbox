          I was not. Sorry! However, much of the press conference was taped by Kyle Hopkins and
          placed on his blog. I'll listen to it and see if I can find any reference to an
          endorsement.  Here's the link for your own reference:
          http://community.adn.com/adn/blog/24417?page=5.   Please let me know if I can be of any
          further help.

          I can't find that reference from Baldino. Pls find her specific quote so you can give to
          Sharon so she can (again) correct the 10 pm's mistake.

          Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll ask Sharon to check on
          what Balding think she heard- pis give Sharon details so she can check. I said weeks ago
          "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate. Those who were with me at
          the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

          don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
          from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
          don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
          shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
