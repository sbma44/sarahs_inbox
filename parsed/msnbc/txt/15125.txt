             May I suggest General Campbell be present at this meeting . He heads the DPC and would be
             the best to respond if the good Senator and Rep's want to get into any detail.

            I agree we should hear them out as soon as possible. I think a videoconference on Monday
            sounds best. If the Governor is not available, we should offer to have at least Tom, Joe,
            and me (the ones in Anchorage Monday morning) meet with them.



            On the AGIA schedule, we're supposed to start up at 2, so we have until then.



            -Pat

             Governor , We all have a packed week yet it would be good to listen to them very early in
             the week. They could have an idea we should consider . Any chance of a 30 minute video
             conference on Monday from Anch to Juneau so no one has to travel? Tom

            We are writing to request that you meet with us in person about the energy crisis
            affecting our home and neighbors, as well as our whole state. Today we received a letter
            from General Campbell, but it does not cover all our concerns and we feel it is still
            critical to discuss these issues with you personally.



            The community of Juneau faces a steep increase in our electricity costs due to losing 1.5
            miles of line and several transmission towers from our hydroelectric power plant at
            Snettisham.  It has been estimated that our electricity costs will be increased by 500%
            for one month and 350% for two additional months.



            The economic impact this will have on our residents, small businesses, and nonprofit
            organizations is huge.  A small business that normally has a $1,000 electric bill will
            have $9,000 in additional costs that were not budgeted, and a household which normally has
            a $100 electric bill during the spring months will have $900 in additional costs. Very
            few businesses and households have the money available to fill that gap.



            Our offices have been contacted by cozens of citizens and businesses who are deeply
            concerned about their ability to survive the increase. In addition, we are incredibly
            concerned about our local school district, which estimates its additional energy costs to
            be in the neighborhood of $400,000, money we are sure everyone would rather see spent on
            textbooks and teachers.



            While we have not seen these increases yet, the entire community is poised on the edge and
            we are readying ourselves for this hit. We know the impact will be devastating. We
            expect the three-month crises will extract $18-20 million from Juneau's economy in direct
            costs alone.




            We are very aware of the energy crisis facing all of Alaska. We want to be part of the
            solution, and we think we have worthwhile ideas that will. lead us forward. We hope that
            you will bee with us so that together we can work to help not only Juneau, but our whole
            state.



            Sincerely, Senator Kim Elton, Representative Beth Kerttula, Representative Andrea Doll
