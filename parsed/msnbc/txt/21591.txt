               Ok boss, Pat and I are getting nervous that you haven't responded or provided any
               feedback.  If you don't like our approach, we can go back to the drawing board tonight.
               Tomorrow will be a busy day, though, and we want to get it in for Friday.

              I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the
              works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don't know if
              something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




              Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
              this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight.   But here are my
              thoughts, for what they are worth , based upon your original draft.
