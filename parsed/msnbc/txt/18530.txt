            Just a note to let you know that I'll be driving with Sen . Therriault and Jay Pullins to Valdez
            next week. We're going to make some stops at DOT camps , DPS trooper detachments, Court
            System, and OCS offices along the way (Glenallen , for example), as well as a few schools.
            I'm slated to talk to the Alaska Power Association conference in Valdez the morning of
            September 13 before we return to Anchorage.
