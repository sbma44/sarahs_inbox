            My sense is that not every commissioner is tech savvy. That means they have staff check
            it for them .... and since it went so widely, staff knows they can get away with leaking.



            It seems like we need to have a frank discussion on thursday about whose email is secure
            and whose is not. In this instance, we tried to have a cabinet discussion via email and
            got a leak... that's not happened when discussions take place in person. Which reinforces
            my suspicion that it wasnt directly from the cabinet.

            We've had a few emails end up in reporters and leggies' hands this past week. Anyone know
            how the press got ahold of Steve's email from Friday, asking for input on energy plan?
