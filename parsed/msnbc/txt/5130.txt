                 Ivy: the Governor may also want to know that appointments to expiring terms on the BOF need to be named by
                 April 1, so that the legislature can confirm the appointments before they adjourn and before the appointment takes
                 effect on July (not June) 1. (see AS 16.0.221 (d)).

                 Have fun, DL.

                 June 1, 2006. The terms expiring are Art Nelson (consultant and son-in-law of Congressman Young) and Robert
                 Heyano from Dillingham.

                 Looking at a Law memo from 1991 the removal provisions say "for cause " and "pleasure of the governor." I'm
                 having Law look at this right now to determine which it is.

                 Thanks,

                 Ivy
