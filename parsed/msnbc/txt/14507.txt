           Governor - I just received a call regarding the Pastor's Conference/Appreciation Banquet
           that you will be attending tonight. Under customary procedure you have two parking spots
           reserved:  Spots 1 and 2 under the covered parking area at the Sheraton. They have also
           offered to have security meet you and escort you to the Howard Rock Ballroom.




           Also, for the Volunteer Appreciation Luncheon for Wed., 04.30.08. I need to confirm your
           entree' of either Top Sirloin or Mango Salmon. Thank you, Janice
