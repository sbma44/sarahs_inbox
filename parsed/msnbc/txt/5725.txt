        The Governor said she could give him a few minutes after 11:30am today.

        Subject: TV Interview Tomorrow



        Bill McAllister just called me. He was quite sick today and unable to

        make it to Juneau. With the first day of AGIA hearings, he will be

        covering the hearings tomorrow for his story.



        However, he would love to spend a few minutes with the Governor to

        talk about the first 100 days. He'll be heading in on the first

        flight - so perhaps sometime between 11am and 2pm would work? It most

        likely won't be a big story - overshadowed by AGIA. But it's our bill,

        so that's good, too.



       Governor, please let us know if we can squeeze him in. Kari, please

        let us know when might be best.



       Thanks,

                                                               1
