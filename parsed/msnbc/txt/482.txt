                                             :.       c e-6
            it tnese options are stiff fine for you aria fne hovernor , mere is no neeu to re-enron . it you want
 to change any of these benefits, we need to complete the new enrollment before 5 pm next Friday, June
 8. The dental and vision are two-year plans and are not eligible for change this year.

 Please let me know if your current selections are ok or if you want to make changes.

 I haven 't had the opportunity to talk to you since you asked about the University tuition reduction
 program . I spoke with Mike Humphrey, the University 's Director of Benefits. He advised me that the
 tuition waiver program does not include employees of the Governor's Office nor the Governor.

 Have a good day Mr. Palin,
 Linda Perez
