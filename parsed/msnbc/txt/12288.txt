           I reminded him of that - so did Nizich. It was an odd meeting with Max Miner in there who
           didn't seem on exactly the same page as Darwin.

           Fyi--you'll recall Darwin Biwer is the sponsor of the gaming commission initiative headed
           for the ballot in August. That initiative creates the commission and empowers it to expand
           gambling in Alaska. Additionally, according to Law, we are not permitted to expend state
           resources either to support or oppose a particular initiative.

           The white paper is contrary to my recollection. He drummed up supporters, and you told
          him you appreciated his support but just couldn't support his efforts to open up gambling
          in the state, essentially that yo,4 couldn't accept $ attached to the special interest. I
          remember a conversation happening right in the middle of the downtown office.

            I wasn 't aware of.a conversation described below or a call from SE. Ivy traveled on
           those SE trips so I'll copy her in.

                    Kris and Frank: I just read my briefing paper for today's meeting I have with
           Darwin Biwer (from Darwin's Theory, I presume ). In this he says I called him during the
           campaign to request his assistance in combating Knowles' effort to oppose gaming... and
           that "the problem never actually came up but we were ready".



                      Huh? Do you remember anything like that ? I remember him coming to our office with
           a group of CHARR guys , and I remember calling him from a Southeast airport to say I
           couldn ' t support their expansion of gaming ideas'. I think I made that call to return his,
           or.because something about the gaming initiative had been in the paper that day?
