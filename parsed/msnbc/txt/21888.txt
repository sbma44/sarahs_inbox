               Wow- this is good.



               Are they returning to AK for Thanksgiving holiday? Would they want to publicly announce
               this with us then?

               Subject :   Congressional Delegation / EXXON Valdez - CONFIDENTIAL -

                        ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE




               I spoke with Senator Stevens about our offer that the congressional delegation join the
               state ' s amicus brief . He was most appreciative that you and the Governor are providing
               this opportunity.



               The Senator said that he would be talking to his two colleagues and then would get back to
               us.  He mentioned that , before receiving the state ' s invitation , the delegation had
               contemplated filing an amicus of their own. The Senator has some personal recollections
               in the immediate aftermath of the Exxon /Valdez accident which he thinks will be helpful to
               the Court but could not easily be inserted into our brief.



               I responded that either a joint brief or two separate ones would be fine with us and
               agreed with him that personal recollections would probably not be appropriate for our
               brief . We agreed that , in any event , we could coordinate on the briefs if we file
               separately.



               My guess is that, as the only lawyer in the delegation,            Senator Stevens '    views will be
                                                                     1

               persuasive with his colleagues.  I haven't heard anything yet from the other two
               delegation members and probably won't until Senator Stevens talks with them directly.



               In the meantime , the Senator asked me to advise him on the deadline for filing amicus
               briefs and when we would intend to file ours .  Could you help me with this? Thanks.
