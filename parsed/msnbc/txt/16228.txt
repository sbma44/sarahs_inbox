           I'd rather not ride the bus.

           They are allowing one guest per invitee however they will accommodate you. Tennys told me
           that she heard from the military today that you would be bringing six. Which is fine (she
           asked that it be no more than that), but she just needs to know for sure as they need to
           make sure to allocate accordingly.



           Also, the working agenda right now:



           5:30: meet at Susitna Club

           7:00 to 7:30pm: meet & greet w/Gov and Wynona

           8:20pm: Gov to welcome Wynona

           8:30pm: Wynona concert

           10:00pm: Concludes

            Governor,



            Regarding the Wynona concert, this from Tennys: a small group of 50 will meet at the
      i
            Susitna Club on Elmendorf and will go to the concert by special escorted buses. Upon
            arrival, there will be a small reception for everyone (a meet and greet for you and small
            group w/Wynona) and the viewing will be from a cat walk type of area on the 2nd floor of
            the hangar which will be a great view of the concert. There will be limited seating up
            there but people can take turns sitting and standing.



            I will talk to Bob on alternate transportation should you not want to ride the bus.
             Tennys needs to know how many will be in attendance with you as there is limited space
            and they need to allocate. She has invited me (and Clark) so we are going but that is
            separate from your count.



            She also asked if you'd be willing to say a few words to welcome Wynona before concert
            begins.  We will nail down the specifics and timing.



            Kris
