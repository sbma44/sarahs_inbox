             Yes, they all should be working. To view them you should be able to access them through
             the  icon on your computer (Pelco). I will follow up as soon as I get to work.

             Tom- did the Security alarm ever get re-set after you explained to Todd last week that
             something was wrong with it? And the security camera doesn't show on the tv or home
             computers anymore. I ask because it's 1:40am and someone's ringing the doorbell again and
             I can't see who it is without going down there (same thing happened Sunday). All is fine,
             but haven't heard if something happened with security camera outdoors.
