          I shouldn't stand on the sidelines for one team over another... I'll start getting into
          tussles with coaches and parents who expect me to be neutral - I learned my lesson on that
          one already.

          I will get these things set up. I spoke with the Juneau Coach and they will not know the
          team until this Sat. evening. It will be either Wasilla, Colony, or North Pole. He will
          let me know.



          NEA will be set up on Oct. 1 as Bill Bjork is out of state through the end of this week.



          I will send up the letter of endorsement that was drafted here in Juneau to Kris and it
          can be run out for your approval/signature.



          When you know what flight times you would all like please let me know .               Thanks , Janice

          Who's Juneau playing? Dinner on friday sounds good. ATIA speech should be short and sweet
          - we've disagreed on cruise taxes and they're not super fond of our admin (but we can talk
          about attracting tourists and changing our image).



          HUB sounds good. We"ll do the letter.



          We also still need to sched NEA leaders who've been asking for mtg.

          Governor - I spoke with the Juneau Football Coach - Bill Chalmers this afternoon. Mr.
          Chalmers would like you and the family to be the "Honorary Coaches" for the Saturday
          evening 8:00 pm. play off game. You would all be recognized and be able to stand at the
          side lines with the coaches. Mr. Chalmers also asked if the dinner could be Friday night
          instead of Thursday.   We would like to bring you down on Thursday so that you could speak
          to the Alaska Travel Industry Association Annual Convention. I am asking for an afternoon
          speaking time.   This includes 500 Tourism Leaders throughout the state. Friday would be
          meetings here in the Juneau office with the football dinner that evening from 7:30 p.m. -
          8:30 p.m. at the Mansion. Saturday would be the play-off game. Then Sunday you would
          travel back to Anchorage on morning or afternoon flight. Another family consideration for
          Juneau would be to view the HUB youth center. Pastor Rose is asking for a letter of
          endorsement for the HUB project, to be used in their fund raising efforts. (We have one
          drafted for you).   Thank you for your consideration, Janice
