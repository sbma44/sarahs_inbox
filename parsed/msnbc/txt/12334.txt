                 Dear Nels,

                 Thanks for this email copy.

                 I am supportive of such a grid , especially one whose foundations are built on hydro like the Susitna
                 dams and Lake Chakachamna . FYI, Dennis Nottingham has a nice map of transmission lines
                 emanating from the big hydro projects at Susitna and running to Dillingham , Bethel , Chignik, the Ahtna
                 region , and more .... and providing for connections to communities all along those routes.

                 Such a project would forever change life for the better throughout the regions served by that grid.
                 Hydro-based power would free us from the roller coaster ride of oil and gas pricing and provide for
                 stable local energy prices throughout what would be a 50 - 100 year project life.

                 There is nothing to stop us from doing such a project except vision and will power. I believe that during
                 this session Representative Craig Johnson has sponsored a bill that would fund a new look at the
                 economics of the hydro projects , I am supportive and hopeful that Alaska would find matching Federal
                 funds for that effort.

                 I trust you and yours are well . Please give my regards to Everett, Greta and Dorothy.

                 Best regards,
                 Bill Noll

                   Dear Governor Palin:
                   I sent this email to Senator Hoffman and Rep . Edgmon asking them to expand the scope of the Railbelt
                   Electrical Grid Authority Study.

                   It has become clear to me that the shortest distance to energy security for our villages is an electric line
                   that connects us to the Railbelt Energy Grid and a yet-to-be constructed Alaska State-Wide Energy
                   Grid.

                   Our energy policy needs to advocate that.our regions across the state begin plans to build regional
                   electrical energy grids. Then we should be working on a policy that will have the state, planning and
                   building an Alaska State -Wide Energy Grid that will ensure that all of our communities across the state
                   will have a long-term, affordable , reliable source of energy.

                                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01 _0012392

                                                                                                                            Page 3 of 5



                   We have vast renewable and nonrenewable resources all across the state that can contribute electrical
                   power to a State-Wide Energy Grid. The Northwest has immense coal supplies, we have geothermal
                   resources all along the Alaska Range and Aleutian Chain, we have hydro power potential, natural gas
                   reserves of untold magnitude, coal-bed methane , peat bogs, wind energy across the state, tidal
                   resources, and many other acceptable alternatives that can have the entire state contributing power to
                   a State-Wide Energy Grid.

                   With Susitna back on the menu of energy sources, it makes sense to expand the Railbelt Energy Grid
                   to include all of the rest of the state of Alaska.
                   In the near term, while we are developing the plans to build a State-Wide Energy Grid, we need to cap
                   our energy costs by initiating electrical and fuel subsidies to stabilize the ever increasing costs of
                   natural gas, gasoline , heating fuel , diesel, aviation fuel , propane , and electricity . Energy costs are
                   approaching unsustainable levels so the state must step in to keep our communities viable until we are
                   all connected to a common State-Wide Energy Grid.

                   Thank you for your consideration on this very important effort to energize the entire state of Alaska.

                   Best regards,

                   Dear Senator Hoffman and Representative Edgmon:




                   As Bristol Bay looks at its energy future, it becomes clear that

                   we have to plan on connecting all of our villages to a common regional

                   energy grid AND eventually into a State-wide Energy Grid.

                   The legislature appropriated $ 800,000 . 00 to do a study on the Railbelt

                   Energy Grid.




                   The Railbelt Electrical Grid Authority study was funded by a legislative

                   appropriation of $800,000 to study the concept of a Railbelt Electrical

                   Grid Authority , an independent system operator ,     to manage and dispatch

                   electric power on the Railbelt Grid . The web page addressing this

                   can be found at http :// www.akenergyauthority . ora/Usohomepage.html.




                   I am asking you to consider expanding that study to make it a State-wide

                   Energy Grid Authority Study to connect all of our communities across the

                   state . If Alaska is going to ever develop its communities across the

                   state , we all have to be connected to a state - wide energy grid to

                   ensure a reliable ,   affordable ,   and long-term source of energy




                   As the Railbelt utilities are economically regulated by the RCA, any

                   interconnection would need to be approved by the RCA .      There would need

                   to be an agreement between all utilities providing power and

                   state - wide   utilities purchasing the power on rates and availability.

                   This would need to be approved by the RCA as well.




                   One comment : now that Susitna Dam is under consideration again, any

                   plans for a transmission line to SW Alaska should be a consideration in

                   the sizing of the Susitna project.




                   In addition , with the prospect of a geothermal project being proposed

                   by the Naknek Electric Association , Bristol Bay could be providing

                   clean energy to the Railbelt and the rest of the state IF we are

                   connected to the Railbelt Energy Grid and/or a State-Wide Energy Grid.




                   Thank you for your consideration.
