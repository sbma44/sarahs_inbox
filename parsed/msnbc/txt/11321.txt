                 Subject : Recent Alaska Aerospace contract awards

                Governor and Mike, just an update on Alaska Aerospace efforts in seeking to expand
                new business opportunities to increase economic development for the state.


                    On January 10, 2008 AADC was awarded a competitively bid USAF
               Contract for $2.7 million for a Minotaur IV launch carrying Air Force Research Lab
               satellites scheduled December 2009.
                    AADC proposed for another Minotaur IV launch carrying Navy Research
               Lab satellites scheduled September 2009; this contract is negotiated for $2.5
               million and planned to be awarded next week.
                    AADC also received a $100,000 contract to study the transportation of the
               launch vehicles to KLC with a potential contract award of up to $1 million
               additional contract per launch.
                    These launches are demonstrators for the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS)
               concept for the Air Force, (i.e. rapid response launches).
                    Existing KLC infrastructure is capable of delivering these two missions with
               a single launch pad even though the schedule will be tight in 2009.
                    However, it will be necessary to upgrade the KLC capabilities with
               additional launch pad and a rocket motor storage facility to accommodate the Air
               Force ORS program and continue to support our current customer the Missile Defense
               Agency (MDA).

               This is a big win for Alaska Aerospace - we are moving into the major leagues now.
