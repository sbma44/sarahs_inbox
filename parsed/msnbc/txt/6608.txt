        Dear Ms. Bettine:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending , live within our means , and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

       Just wanted to let you know that Mike and I are very proud of your veto pen. I just
       reviewed the 18 pages of cuts that were posted on the ADN page. What you did was a very
       hard task.   I especially happy that you are interested in letting local government have a
       bigger roll in spending the state oil revenue through revenue sharing with local public
       comment.   This is especailly important with a state our size and the capital so far from
       the majority of the public. While I am sorry to see the Willow/Pt. Mac EIS funds cut, the
       Borough and the ARR can step up for such an important economic developement project for
       Mat Su.

       Thanks for being fiscally responcible!

       Cindy Bettine
