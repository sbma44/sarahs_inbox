Subject:                Lyda




I received a call on my personal cell as 1 was walking into Petersburg speech this afternoon - it was a
guy mad about ABC Board not granting his fundraiser a liquor license permit for their event tomorrow
night - asked me to work on it - I explained I was hundreds of miles away, it's a board decision, I was
about to give a speech any minute, etc... So he should call his local legislator instead, if he could. He
said he did - it was Lyda - and Lyda instead gave him my personal cell #. .



So next time constituents have issues re: the Valley, we're free to give out her personal #, eh?
