         Subject: GUEST LIST QUESTION- Friends of the Governor's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser,
        May 9th, 2007 at the Residence




        Hello Governor and Mr. Palin,




        The list of lobbyists for the Friends of the Governor's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser are
        listed below for your review/approval. I've also attached the 2007 Lobbyist Directory in
        case you wanted the client/employer information. Please let me know if you'd like to make
        any changes or have any additional guests that you'd like to include.




       F.Y.I. - The Foundation pays for the food, beverage, and staff over time expenses , so that
       it's not an expense that the House incurs. I have a copy of a memorandum from the
       Department of Law from March 14, 2005 where the question was asked if there would be any
       Executive Ethics Act (AS 39.52) or other legal concerns presented if the foundation held a
       fundraiser at the Governor' s Mansion and the conclusion (was that the First Lady

                                                         4



                                                                                                     PRA GSP01_0001626

         (Gentleman in this case) is not a "public official" under the Ethics Act, the strictures
        of the Act do not apply to her/him. The Governor may also host fundraising activities at
        the residence, and he may freely invite guests and host functions as he/she deems proper.
          Of course, there is much more information, and this is paraphrased, but I wanted you to
        be aware of some of the issues that have been addressed. I could fax a copy to you if
        you'd like.




        If at all possible, it would be great to have the final guest list as soon as possible, as
        May 9th is quickly approaching.




        Thank you,



        Erika
