             Mike- pis add to tomorrow's Cabinet agenda: update from Rhonda on rural issues she's
             encountering w/her job (pls let her know we'll request this update - if she's in Anchorage
             it'll be via conf-ing in), and Mindy w/an update on legislation in the hopper and what
             she's hearing from leggies on any of our initiatives.. Any head's up she can give
             commissioners re: leggies activities we need to know about. Thanks



            Also, I'm inviting whomever wants to come over to Gov's House tomorrow evening to watch
            Super Tuesday results be broadcast. We have a tv downstairs and food. I'll ask Mindy to
            let leggies know they're welcome to come over (Ivy's doing the same), and I want our staff
            to know they're invited too... Remind me to let them know at Cabinet mtg - but also let
            them know today via email (I'11 cc Janice so she can invite them). There's food over
            there. It'll be good.

            Governor:

            I have two presentations for the Cabinet meeting tomorrow:

            1)  It will take at least 60 days for SU to conduct a strike vote. We won't know if they
            intend to do that until afte the arbitrator's d ecisi on ( on the Class One employees who
            cannot strike) later today. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                                                                                            At-tom
            Cabinet meeting, I'll be passing out the strike plans last done in 1996 and asking
            Commissioners to update them, first with SU in mind, and second - they need to be
            refreshed as a whole anyway. I'll have the lists of SU employees by department for each
            Commissioner, and a list of SU members by community location (trying to anticipate how
            Commissioners will want to see information).

            We will have the arbitrator's decision on Class One employees and I'll be sharing
                                                                   1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01 0011322

            highlights from that . I may not talk strategy in front of the whole Cabinet if you have
            not been briefed privately prior to the Cabinet meeting.

            2) The second presentation is the roll out of the AO 237            working Group report to the
            Cabinet . I'll have binders for each Cabinet member, one            for the Press Office , for Anna
            Kim-Special Assistant with DOA responsibilities ; and, of           course for you and Mike .  I'll be
            doing a private briefing with union management after the            Cabinet meeting and then it will
            go up on the web with a media release.

            Thanks - and re : SU I'll j ust need to know strike plans if it looks like that's where
            folks are headed . Also, the public is not aware of the 40 / hr provision that goes along w/
            the raise we're offering . They need to know that , they'll appreciate it, when will
            Alaskans become aware of the offer ? It's good for Alaska.

            we'll get on it today. The arbitrator's ruling on Class One SU employees is due today,
            just FYI.  We'll respond after we have a chance to review with Law.

             I'd like to do it tomorrow to get it out of the way. Again, not a big media splash, but a
            sit down with reporters who are interested so they can really grasp where we're going:
            con't evaluation of structure, MOU, won't fight the legislature on its efforts to study
            the move and decide on their pending legislation to move it back... Committment to sound
            oversight and publicly supported permitting process, Etc.



             This media discussion can coincide with our explanation of the state's on-line checkbook
            that can begin tomorrow. I'll get an update on that and ask Annette to be ready for that
            tomorrow too. Thanks

             We will be working on the details of habitat roll out today. Have not set a day for
            announcements .  Do you have any preferences? We will make sure statements and day are
            coordinated with you and the 3rd floor. I just arrived in Anchorage. I will be flying to
            Juneau tonight.  God bless.  Tom
