         Governor -




         A scheduling request that was regretted for Saturday, September 29, 2007 - Valdez. This
         request was for you to speak at the Fire Fighters and Fire Chiefs Conference @ 6:00 p.m.




         The Fire Chief George Keeney has now contacted Mayor            Cottle which in turn has contacted
         your office asking that you please attend. The Mayor            has contacted Alaska Airlines and
         they are willing to hold the plane (10 extra minutes)           so that you would get off - give a
         10 minute speech to the Fire Fighters and Fire Chiefs            and then be back on the plane.
         There will be approx. 450 in attendance.




         Alaska

                                     Omar Stratman - Southwest/Kenai Peninsula

                      The FSWCD believes that each of these. candidates will serve the state of Alaska with
                      experience, knowledge and integrity.
                      Sincere],


                            e Norum, FSWCD Board Chairman


                      Anthony Gas'b8rro, FSWCD Board Vice Chairman
                                   /

                      Timothammond, FS WCD Board Secretary/Treasurer

                     /ennifer Miller, FSWCD B           Supe

                          1. NRCDB Board of Directors: Thu moves for the Chairman to draft a letter
                             specific to 4 candidates: Perry Mendenhall, Dick Zobel, Shirley Schollenberg, &
                             Omar Stratman. Randy 2nds. Roll Call Vote - All yes. Motion passed without
                             objection.
                          2. Per a conversation I had this morning with a representatives from APOC & the
                             Attorney General's office, there is nothing inappropriate with Supervisors or
                             Districts making a recommendation to the Governor for appointments to be made.
