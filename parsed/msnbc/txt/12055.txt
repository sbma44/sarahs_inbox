                                    Argument .................................... 5

                                        I. The Court of Appeals Correctly Held That the
                                           Second Amendment Guarantees an Individual
                                           Right to Keep and Bear Arms .............. 5

                                           A.   The   Second Amendment's          Text
                                                Guarantees an Individual Right to Keep
                                                and Bear Arms ..................... 5

                                                1.    The "right of the people" is an
                                                      individual right ............... 6

                                                2.    The District misinterprets the
                                                      meaning of "keep" and "bear
                                                      Arms" ....................... 9

                                                3.    The Second Amendment's
                                                      introductory clause does not
                                                      convert an individual right into
                                                      a "collective " or "quasi-
                                                      collective" right .............. 11

                                           B.   The Court's Precedent Supports the
                                                Principle That the Second Amendment
                                                Guarantees an Individual Right ...... 15

                                           C.   The Weight of Scholarly Commentary
                                                Also Supports the Conclusion That the
                                                Second Amendment Guarantees an
                                                Individual Right to Keep and Bear
                                                Arms ............................ 18

                                           D.   The Second Amendment's History
                                                Demonstrates That It Guarantees an
                                                Individual Right to Arms .......... 21

                                       II. The Court of Appeals Correctly Held That the
                                           District of Columbia' s Firearms Regulations Are
                                           Unconstitutional ........................ 24

                                           A.   The Court of Appeals 's Decision Should
                                                Be Affirmed Because Statutes Effectively
                                                Prohibiting   Any       Citizen   From
                                                Keeping and Bearing "Arms" Are
                                                Unconstitutional .................. 26

                                                1.    The D.C. Code provisions
                                                      concern "Arms" protected under
                                                      the Second Amendment ....... 26

                                                2.    The court of appeals correctly
                                                      concluded that the District's
                                                      statutes are unconstitutional ... 28

                                              B.   The Court of Appeals 's Decision Should
                                                   Be Affirmed Because the District's

                                                     INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE

                                       Amici, the State of Texas and 30 other States, have an
                                    interest in this case because of its potential impact on
                                    their citizens' constitutional rights. The individual right
                                    to keep and bear arms is protected by the United States
                                    Constitution and the constitutions of forty-four States.`
                                    Given the significance of this fundamental right, the
                                    States have a substantial interest in ensuring that the
                                    Second Amendment is accorded its proper scope.
                                        The amici States believe that the court of appeals's
                                    decision-that the Second Amendment protects an
                                    individual right to keep and bear arms-is correct and
                                    fully consistent with the Framers' intent. Moreover, the
                                    District of Columbia's categorical gun ban is markedly out
                                    of step with the judgment of the legislatures of the fifty
                                    States, all of which protect the right of private citizens to
                                    own handguns.

                                    relevant state constitutional and statutory provisions concerning

                                                                 2

                                                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

                                       Described by Justice Joseph Story as "the palladium of
                                    the liberties of the republic," the right to keep and bear
                                    arms enjoys prominent placement at the outset of the Bill
                                    of Rights. Yet the central issue in this case is whether
                                    that constitutional provision retains any vitality
                                    whatsoever.
                                       The District of Columbia's position, as the court of
                                    appeals explained, is that "the Second Amendment is a
                                    dead letter."     Pet. App. 13a.       That ahistorical
                                    contention-supported by modern-day advocates who
                                    disagree with the policy judgments embodied in that
                                    Amendment-runs contrary to both the text and the
                                    original understanding of our Constitution.
                                        Because the Second Amendment's text recognizes a
                                    "right," not a "power," and guarantees that right to "the
                                    people" and not "the States," it necessarily secures an
                                    individual right to keep and bear arms. The First, Fourth,
                                    and Ninth Amendments likewise protect the "rights" of
                                    "the people," and none dispute that those Amendments
                                    protect individual rights. The Tenth Amendment, in turn,
                                    expressly distinguishes between "the States" and "the
                                    people," demonstrating that the Framers knew well the
                                    difference. And, this Court has made clear, "the people" is
                                    a term of art, with the same meaning throughout the Bill
                                    of Rights.
                                       The District's contrary position is based largely upon a
                                    misconstruction of the Amendment's prefatory clause.
                                    Although the preamble states that keeping a well-
                                    regulated militia is one purpose of the right, nothing in
                                    that statement contradicts the Amendment's operative

                                                                  3

                                    language . The District's interpretation of that prefatory
                                    language as limiting the Amendment only to members of
                                    organized state militias runs contrary to the
                                    understanding-and statutory definition-at the time of
                                    the Founding that all able-bodied males armed with their
                                    own private weapons comprised the "Militia."
                                       The court of appeals's ruling is also consistent with this
                                    Court's decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174
                                    (1939). That brief and famously opaque opinion can be
                                    read to support multiple interpretations , but the better
                                    reading is that the right to keep and bear arms is an
                                    individual right . Indeed, Miller makes sense only if the
                                    Court believed that the Second Amendment protects
                                    individual rights; otherwise , virtually all of the Miller
                                    Court's analysis would be rendered superfluous.
                                      That view is further buttressed by an unbroken line of
                                   commentary from the Framers to nineteenth -century
                                   scholars to the bulk of modern scholarship . Indeed, the
                                   unmistakable trend among constitutional scholars-even
                                   those who might otherwise . disfavor private firearms
                                   possession-is toward recognition that the Second
                                   Amendment protects an individual right, as its plain text
                                   suggests.
                                       Reasonable minds can differ about the Second
                                   Amendment's scope-that is , about which government
                                   regulations are permissible . And subsequent cases may
                                   well present difficult questions about where precisely to
                                   draw that line . Those vexing issues are not presented in
                                   this case, however, and are appropriately left to another
                                   day.

                                                                 4

                                       This case instead presents two straightforward
                                    questions, each of which will determine whether the
                                    Second Amendment has any modern relevance . First, as
                                    a threshold matter, does the Amendment protect any
                                    individual rights at all. And second, do the challenged
                                    District ordinances-which collectively prohibit the
                                    possession of any functioning firearm in one's own
                                    home-run afoul of that right.
                                       On more difficult questions involving the Amendment's
                                    application-such as registration requirements and
                                    comprehensive regulation-the many amici States may
                                    well part ways . But the two questions in this case are, in
                                    the eyes of amici, not difficult. If the answer to either
                                    question were in the negative , then the Second
                                    Amendment's protections would be rendered illusory.
                                        For the same reason, the amici States believe that the
                                    Department of Justice's position that this case should be
                                    vacated and remanded is indefensible .        Under any
                                    standard, including that advocated by the Department, a
                                    total prohibition on the possession of any functioning
                                    firearm cannot be sustained . The District' s ordinances
                                    facially prohibit Mr. Heller from ever possessing a
                                    handgun in his own home or from possessing an operable
                                    long gun.

                                       An individual right that can be altogether abrogated is
                                   no right at all. Amici States are sovereign governmental
                                   bodies with strong interests in maintaining extant
                                   regulations barring, for example, convicted felons from
                                   possessing firearms . But none of the 31 amici States
                                   believes that its citizens' constitutional rights should be
                                   effectively erased from the Bill of Rights. Because, under
                                   any standard, a total prohibition on the possession of

                                    firearms cannot be reconciled with the individual right to
                                    keep and bear arms , the court of appeals 's judgment
                                    should be affirmed.
                                                            ARGUMENT

                                    I.   THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY HELD THAT THE
                                         SECOND AMENDMENT GUARANTEES AN INDIVIDUAL
                                         RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.

                                        The court of appeals's holding that the Second
                                    Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear
                                    arms, Pet. App. 44a, gives effect to the Amendment's plain
                                    text and reflects the structure of the Bill of Rights. It is
                                    consistent with the views of the Framers, the great weight
                                    of scholarly commentary, and this Court's precedent.
                                         A. The Second Amendment' s Text Guarantees an
                                            Individual Right to Keep and Bear Arms.
                                        The Second Amendment provides, "[a] well regulated
                                    Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
                                    right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
                                    infringed." U.S. CONST. amend. II. The Court has long
                                    emphasized the importance of the Constitution's specific
                                    text: "[T]he enlightened patriots who framed our
                                    Constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be
                                    understood to have employed words in their natural sense,
                                    and to have intended what they said." Pollock v. Farmers'

                                                 1.     The "right of the people" is an
                                                        individual right.
                                      The Second Amendment's operative words protect the
                                   right of "the people," not the "militia" and not the "States,"
                                   to keep and bear arms. The meaning to be given to the
                                   words "the people" as used in the Second Amendment
                                   phrase "the right of the people" should be the same
                                   meaning attributed to that same phrase in the
                                   contemporaneously submitted and ratified First and
                                   Fourth Amendments. Pet. App. 18a; United States v.
                                   Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 227 (5th Cir. 2001). And all three
                                   amendments describe personal, individual rights.
                                       In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, the Court
                                    concluded that the words "the people" bear special
                                    significance in the context of the Bill of Rights:
                                          "'[T]he people'seems to have been a term of
                                          art employed in select parts of the
                                          Constitution.... The Second Amendment
                                          protects `the right of the people to keep and
                                          bear Arms,' and the Ninth and Tenth
                                          Amendments provide that certain rights and
                                          powers are retained by and reserved to `the
                                          people.' See also U.S. Const. Amdt. 1 ... ;
                                          Art. I, § 2, cl. I .... While this textual
                                          exegesis is by no means conclusive, it
                                          suggests that `the people' protected by the

                                          Second Amendments, and to whom rights

                                           sufficient connection with this country to be
                                           considered part of that community." 494
                                           U.S. 259, 265 (1990) (emphasis added).
                                           The Court has thus made clear that the "term of
                                    art" "the people" has the same meaning in the First,
                                    Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments . And it is
                                    beyond peradventure that the right of "the people" in the
                                    First and Fourth Amendments is an individual, personal
                                    right rather than a "collective " right or a right protected
                                    only in connection with service to the government. See,
                                    e.g., Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95 (1940) ("The
                                    freedom of speech ... which [is] secured by the First
                                    Amendment against abridgment by the United States, [is]

                                    v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998) (holding that the Fourth
                                    Amendment is a personal right that must be invoked by
                                    an individual).
                                          The District's assertion that the Second
                                   Amendment's right of "the people" merely ensures a
                                   collective right "to prevent Congress, using its powers
                                   under the Militia Clauses , from disarming state militias,"
                                   Petitioners' Br. 35, is fundamentally inconsistent with the
                                   rest of the Bill of Rights. If the phrase "the people" is
                                   interpreted consistently-as the Court has instructed-the
                                   District's construction of the phrase results in an
                                   implausible framework for our constitutional rights. For
                                   example, the First Amendment preserves "the right of the

                                    CONST. amend. IV. The District's construction implies
                                    that no individual has a right enforceable in court to be
                                    free from unreasonable search and seizure, because only
                                    "the people" as a collective may enforce such rights. That,
                                    of course, is not the law.
                                           Alternatively, if the District's "collective"
                                    construction of "the people" is somehow to be cabined only
                                    to the Second Amendment, the Court must conclude that
                                    when Congress sent the Bill of Rights to the States,
                                    Congress first listed four individual rights (in the First
                                    Amendment), then created a State's "right" (in the Second
                                    Amendment), and then reverted to a litany of individual
                                    rights (in Amendments Three through Eight). The Court
                                    must further conclude that, while Congress used "the
                                    people" to refer to individual rights in the First, Fourth,
                                    and Ninth Amendments, Congress used "the people" to
                                    mean "state governments" in the Second Amendment.
                                    Finally, for the Court to find that Congress used "the
                                    people" in the Second Amendment to mean "the States," it
                                    would have to somehow reconcile that with the Tenth
                                    Amendment's language, where Congress explicitly
                                    distinguished "the people" from "the States," reserving
                                    powers "to the States respectively, or to the people."
                                          Moreover, the concept of a collective "right" or a
                                   State's "right" is contrary to the Constitution's structure
                                   and language; in the Hohfeldian taxonomy, States have
                                   powers, not rights. Rights are reserved to individuals; as
                                   Mill explained, "[t]o have a right . . . is . . . to have

                                    (Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green 1864)
                                    (1861).
                                           Put simply, the words "the right of the people"
                                    cannot fairly be read to mean a collective power of the
                                    Militia. Rather, the Second Amendment's text means
                                    what it says: the individual right of the people to keep and
                                    bear arms cannot be infringed.
                                                 2.     The District. misinterprets the
                                                        meaning of "keep" and "bear
                                                        Arms."
                                          The District's interpretation of the Second
                                   Amendment necessarily, and mistakenly, requires that the
                                   words "bear Arms" have only a military connotation, and
                                   that the words "keep" and "bear" arms in the Second
                                   Amendment be construed together as a unitary phrase
                                   relating only to maintaining arms for military service. See
                                   Petitioners' Br. 12-17.       This construction of the
                                   Amendment is not supported by its text or history.
                                          The first problem with the District's interpretation
                                   of "keep and bear Arms" is that it effectively ignores the
                                   word "keep." Id. Indeed, the District suggests that "keep"
                                   has no independent meaning, and was inserted merely to
                                   bolster the militia's ability to bear arms. Id., at 16-17. But
                                   courts cannot ignore words or phrases in the Constitution.
                                   "In expounding the Constitution of the United States,
                                   every word must have its due force, and appropriate
                                   meaning; for it is evident from the whole instrument, that
                                   no word was unnecessarily used, or needlessly added."

                                    demonstrated by the contemporary dictionary definition of
                                    "keep":
                                          "1. To hold; to retain in one's power or
                                          possession ; not to lose or part with; as, to
                                          keep a house or a farm; to keep any thing in
                                          the memory, mind or heart; 2. To have in
                                          custody for security or preservation."

                                          ENGLISH LANGUAGE (4th ed. 1770).
                                          The Court should give effect, as did the court of
                                   appeals, to each word of the Amendment. Pet. App. 27a
                                   ('[K]eep' is a straightforward term that implies ownership
                                   or possession of a functioning weapon by an individual for

                                          The District's assertion that "bear Arms" refers only
                                   to militia service is likewise misguided. Although this
                                   phrase may be used to describe the carrying or wearing of
                                   arms by a soldier or member of the militia, it is not used
                                   exclusively to refer to the military. Indeed, the Framers
                                   understood "bearing" arms to include the carrying of
                                   weapons generally-as may be seen directly in a bill
                                   drafted by Thomas Jefferson and proposed to the Virginia
                                   Legislature by James Madison (the author of the Second
                                   Amendment) on October 31, 1785. Madison's bill would
                                   have imposed penalties upon one who violated hunting
                                   laws if he were to "bear a gun out of his [the violator's]
                                   inclosed ground, unless whilst performing military duty."

                                    omitted).
                                           This common-sense view of the phrase "bear Arms"
                                    is also reflected in Justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion,
                                    joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and
                                    Souter, in Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 143
                                    (1998):
                                           "Surely a most familiar meaning [of carrying
                                           a firearm] is, as the Constitution's Second
                                           Amendment (`keep and bear Arms')
                                           (emphasis added) and Black's Law
                                           Dictionary, at 214, indicate: `wear, bear, or

                                           person"'
                                           Nothing in the Second Amendment's text limits the
                                    words "bear Arms" to an exclusively military connotation;
                                    instead it affords an individual right to "the people" to
                                    "wear, bear, or carry" arms, regardless of whether they are
                                    engaged in military activity connected with a state militia.
                                                 3.     The     Second     Amendment's
                                                        introductory clause does not
                                                        convert an individual right into a

                                        The District's "quasi-collective right" position is

                                    "keep and bear Arms," is defined and impliedly narrowed
                                    by the Amendment's introductory clause referencing a
                                    "well regulated Militia." Petitioners' Br. 12-18. But,
                                    although a preamble may inform, influence, or shape the
                                    operational clause, it cannot compel a result contrary to its
                                    meaning . See Eugene Volokh, The Commonplace Second
                                    Amendment, 73 N.Y.U. L. REv. 793, 807 (1998). And, in
                                    any event, the Second Amendment's preamble is entirely
                                    consistent with the individual right mandated by the
                                    operational clause.
                                          To be sure, the introductory clause implies that a
                                    principal purpose of the right to bear arms is to promote
                                   the existence and effectiveness of a "well-regulated
                                   Militia." But nothing compels the conclusion that this is
                                   .the Amendment's only purpose.
                                            With respect to other rights recognized by the
                                   Constitution, the Court has already held that similar
                                   preambulatory purposes do not limit the effect of the
                                   clauses' operational language. For example, in Eldred v.
                                   Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003), the Court addressed a
                                   similar proposed construction of the preambulatory
                                   language in the Copyright Clause, which reads "[T]he
                                   Congress shall have the power . . . [t]o promote the

                                   their respective Writings and Discoveries." U.S. CONST.
                                   art. I, §8, cl. 8. The Court concluded that Congress's power
                                   to secure exclusive rights to authors and inventors is not
                                   limited by the prefatory purpose to "promote the progress
                                   of science and useful arts." 537 U.S., at 210-211. Although
                                   promoting science and the arts may have been the
                                   Framers' chief purpose in conveying sweeping copyright
                                   powers to Congress, other purposes existed as well. Id., at

                                    phrase "by securing," imposes no limitation on the
                                    Clause's scope, then neither does the Second Amendment's

                                           And, even if the District were correct that the
                                    Second Amendment's prefatory clause defined the scope of
                                    the right conferred in the operational clause, the District's
                                    further conclusion-that the words "a well-regulated
                                    Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State"
                                    means the Amendment was adopted for the sole purpose
                                    of ensuring the effectiveness of state militias-is
                                    erroneous. The Amendment's text and history contradict
                                    this narrow reading of "Militia."
                                           The Framers' understanding of "Militia" is reflected
                                    in a question asked by George Mason, one of the
                                    Virginians who refused to sign the Constitution because of
                                    its lack of a Bill of Rights: "Who are the Militia? They
                                    consist now of the whole people ." 3 J. ELLIOTT, DEBATES IN

                                    12) posed no threat to liberty because any such army, if
                                    misused, "would be opposed [by] a militia amounting to
                                    near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands."
                                    THE FEDERALIST No. 46, at 334 (James Madison)
                                    (Benjamin Wright ed., 1961).
                                           The District' s narrow interpretation of "Militia" to
                                    include only some select body of permanent soldiers is also
                                    belied by the provisions of the Militia Act, enacted by the
                                    Second Congress the year after the Second Amendment's
                                    ratification. The Militia Act expressly defined the militia
                                    as "each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of
                                    the respective states, resident therein, who is or shall be
                                    of the age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five
                                    years." Militia Act, ch. XXXIII, 1 Stat. 271, 271 (1792).2
                                    Thus, the "Militia" contemplated by the Framers was not
                                    limited to those enrolled in some type of state or local
                                    militia organization. Under.statute and contemporary
                                    understanding, the militia was all able-bodied male
                                    citizens from eighteen to forty-five, whether they were
                                    organized into a state-sponsored fighting force or not. See
                                    Silveira, 328 F.3d at 578-80 (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting).
                                          The Framers were understandably wary of standing
                                    armies and the powers of a potentially oppressive
                                    government. Therefore, the individual right to bear arms
                                    ensures a ready "Militia" consisting of each and every
                                    able-bodied male between the ages of eighteen to forty-
                                    five.  The introductory clause, properly understood,
                                    confirms the primary benefit of the operational clause-a


                                             2. Indeed, the Militia Act not only permitted gun ownership
                                   by every able-bodied man, it required it-obliging by law each man to
                                   "provide himself with a good musket or firelock ... or with a good
                                   rifle ." Militia Act , 1 Stat., at 271 (emphasis added).

                                           B.     The Court's Precedent Supports the
                                                  Principle That the Second Amendment
                                                  Guarantees an Individual Right.
                                           The Court's decision in Miller buttresses the
                                    principle that the Second Amendment's text and history
                                    establish its protection of the rights of individuals to keep
                                    and bear arms. In Miller, the Court considered a Second
                                    Amendment challenge as applied to a sawed-off shotgun:
                                           "In the absence of any evidence tending to
                                           show that possession or use of a `shotgun
                                           having a barrel of less than eighteen inches
                                           in length' at this time has some reasonable
                                           relationship to the preservation or efficiency
                                           of a well regulated militia, we cannot say
                                           that the Second Amendment guarantees the
                                           right to keep and bear such an instrument.
                                           Certainly it is not within judicial notice that
                                           this weapon is any part of the ordinary
                                           military equipment or that its use could
                                           contribute to the common defense." 307 U.S.,
                                           at 178.
                                           Miller is less than a model of clarity, but a fair
                                    reading of that opinion confirms that the Second
                                    Amendment protects individual rights. If the Second
                                    Amendment protected only the right to bear arms in a
                                    militia, the Court could easily have disposed of the case
                                    merely by observing that Miller was not a member of any

                                    state militia. Thus, with one sentence, the case could have
                                    been resolved.'
                                          Instead, the Court based its ruling on the lack of
                                   judicial notice that a short-barreled shotgun, a weapon
                                   typically used by gangsters in the 1930s and associated
                                   with criminal activity, was the type of weapon that
                                   contributed to "the common defense." Id. The Court's
                                   decision implicitly acknowledged that the possession by
                                   individual Americans of weapons that could be part of the
                                   "ordinary military equipment" contributing to the common
                                   defense-as opposed to criminal activity-is protected by
                                   the Second Amendment.
                                          The Court's conclusions in Miller also suggest an
                                   understanding that the Framers envisioned a militia
                                   composed of the entire people-possessed of their
                                   individually owned arms-as necessary for. the protection
                                   of a free State. The Court expressly observed that, in the
                                   Framers'time, the militia "comprised all males physically
                                   capable of acting in concert for the common defense ....
                                   [O]rdinarily when called for service these men were
                                   expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves
                                   and of a kind in common use at the time." Id., at 179
                                   (emphasis added).
                                         Later opinions of the Court also support the
                                   individual-right view, albeit. in dicta. In Johnson v.
                                   Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950), the Court rejected a
                                   claim that the Fifth Amendment's criminal-procedure
                                   protections applied to nonresident enemy aliens by


                                           3. Indeed, the United States raised the collective rights
                                   argument in its brief as its very first argument, Pet. App. 40a, and,
                                   notably, the Court declined to rule on that basis.

                                    (1961), the Court, citing Miller, again equated the Second

                                    281-82 (1897), the Court observed,
                                          "The law is perfectly well settled that the
                                          first 10 amendments to the constitution,
                                          commonly known as the `Bill of Rights,' were
                                          not intended to lay down any novel principles
                                          of government, but simply to embody certain
                                          guaranties and immunities which we had
                                          inherited from our English ancestors, and
                                          which had, from time immemorial, been
                                          subject to certain well-recognized exceptions,
                                          arising from the necessities of the case....
                                          Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press
                                          (article 1) does not permit the publication of
                                          libels ... [and] the right of the people to keep
                                          and bear arms (article 2) is not infringed by

                                          Repeatedly, the Court has described the Second
                                    Amendment, consistent with the analysis in Miller, as an
                                    individual right-like the others in the Bill of Rights and
                                    subject to similar restrictions.
                                           C.      The Weight of Scholarly Commentary
                                                   Also Supports the Conclusion That the
                                                   Second Amendment Guarantees an
                                                   Individual Right to Keep and Bear
                                                   Arms.
                                           As Justice Thomas has written, "a growing body of
                                    scholarly commentary indicates that the `right to keep and
                                    bear arms' is, as the Amendment's text suggests, a
                                    personal right."'    The unmistakable       trend among
                                    constitutional scholars is towards recognizing that the
                                    Second Amendment confers a personal, individual right.
                                    For example, although arguing for a narrow construction
                                    of the Amendment, Professor Laurence Tribe has squarely
                                    concluded that the Second Amendment provides a "right
                                    (admittedly of uncertain scope) on the part of individuals
                                    to possess and use firearms in the defense of themselves
                                    and their homes." 1 LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN

                                   Professor Nelson Lund maintains that the Amendment
                                   confers an individual right to keep and bear arms, and
                                   thereby helps to protect "the most fundamental individual
                                   right, the right of self-defense." Nelson Lund, The Second

                                   Joyce Lee Malcolm has found that the Amendment's
                                   historical lineage favors the interpretation that it
                                   guarantees an individual right to arms . See, generally,

                                   When St. George Tucker published his five-volume edition
                                   of Blackstone's Commentaries in 1803, he observed that
                                   "[w]herever standing armies are kept up, and the right of
                                   the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or
                                   pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already
                                   annihilated, is on the brink of destruction." WILLIAM
                                   BLACKSTONE, 1 COMMENTARIES 300 (St. George Tucker ed.,
                                   Augustus M. Kelley 1969) (1803). He further pointedly
                                   criticized the English Bill of Rights for limiting its
                                   guarantee of arms ownership to Protestants, while the
                                   American right was "without any qualification as to their
                                   condition or degree, as is the case in the British
                                   government." Id. at 143.
                                           Thomas Cooley directly addressed the issue of the
                                   scope of the Amendment' s guarantee : "It might be
                                   supposed from the phraseology of [the Second
                                   Amendment] that the right to keep and bear arms was
                                   only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an
                                   interpretation not warranted by the intent . . . . [T]he
                                   meaning of the [amendment] undoubtedly is, that the
                                   people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have
                                   the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no
                                   permission or regulation of law for the purpose ." THOMAS
                                   M. COOLEY, THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL

                                   & Co. 1981) (1880) (emphasis added). Justice Joseph
                                   Story similarly concluded that the "right of the citizens to
                                   keep, and bear arms has justly been considered, as the
                                   palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a
                                   strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary
                                   power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are
                                   successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist,

                                    ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES 708-09
                                    (Carolina Academic Press 1987) (1833).
                                          These contemporary scholars understood that the
                                   Second Amendment guaranteed each American the right
                                   to "keep" and "bear" arms as the foundation of the militia
                                   that would provide security for a "free" State. If the people
                                   were disarmed there could be no militia (well-regulated or
                                   otherwise) as understood by the Framers.
                                          D.    The Second Amendment's History
                                                Demonstrates That It Guarantees an
                                                Individual Right to Arms.
                                          The historical context of the Second Amendment
                                   also supports the court of appeals's conclusion that it
                                   guarantees an individual right to arms.          When the
                                   Amendment was adopted, the drafters undoubtedly looked
                                   to the provisions in many of the state constitutions as
                                   models. Volokh, supra, at 814-21. At that time, almost
                                   half of the States with bills of rights included provisions
                                   recognizing that right. Nelson Lund, The Past and Future

                                   (1996).
                                          The Framers were also guided by the evolution of
                                   individual rights in England. As the Court has stated,
                                   "[t]he historical necessities and events of the English
                                   constitutional experience . . . were familiar to" the
                                   Framers and should "inform our understanding of the
                                   purpose and meaning of constitutional provisions." Loving
                                   v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 766 (1996).
                                          The English Declaration of Rights of 1689 came
                                   approximately a century before our own. It provided that
                                   "the subjects which are protestants, may have arms for

                                    5 THE FOUNDERS CONSTITUTION 210 (Philip B. Kurland &
                                    Ralph Lerner eds., 1987)). The right of the English
                                    Monarch's "subjects" to have arms is by its terms an
                                    individual one, and it was so understood by William
                                    Blackstone, who provided the standard reference work for
                                    Colonial and early American lawyers.
                                           Blackstone explained that the right of "having"
                                    arms is among the five basic rights of every Englishman,
                                   which were essential to secure the "primary rights" of each
                                   individual . WILLIAM BLACKSTONE , 1 COMMENTARIES 136,
                                    139 (Legal Classics Library 1983) (1765). Blackstone saw
                                   the right to bear arms as a natural right because it arose
                                   from the natural right of self- preservation and the right of
                                   "resistance ... to the violence of oppression ." Id., at 139.
                                   Blackstone's conception of the individual right to bear
                                   arms as protection against oppression would have been
                                   particularly relevant to the Framers , who had themselves
                                   just taken part in a bloody struggle against the oppression
                                   of the English Crown.
                                          Thus, the Framers' own experience informed their
                                   understanding of the "right of the people to keep and bear
                                   Arms," and the fundamental relationship of this right to
                                   "the security of a free State." The Framers recognized
                                   that the best security against an oppressive regime was a
                                   free citizenry capable of defending its rights.. As
                                   Alexander Hamilton explained,
                                          "if circumstances should at any time oblige
                                          the government to form an army of any
                                          magnitude that army can never be
                                          formidable to the liberties of the people while

                                            of arms, who stand ready to defend their own
                                            rights and those of theirfellow-citizens." THE
                                            FEDERALIST No. 29, at 229 (Alexander
                                            Hamilton) (Benjamin Wright ed., 1961).
                                           The Second Amendment answered the potential
                                    threat of a standing army with the guarantee that
                                    individual citizens could not be disarmed. The Framers
                                    saw that individual right as an essential bulwark of the
                                    people's liberties. This Court should as well, and should
                                    affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.'



                                           6.    Although the Court need not reach the issue of
                                   incorporation in this case , amici States submit that the right to keep
                                   and bear arms is fundamental and so is properly subject to
                                   incorporation . To be sure , early decisions of this Court cast doubt on
                                   Second Amendment incorporation , see United States v . Cruikshank, 92
                                   U.S. 542 , 553 (1875); Presser v. Illinois , 116 U. S. 252 , 264-65 ( 1886),
                                   but those opinions predated the Court's broad -based incorporation of
                                   the Bill of Rights against the States . See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391
                                   U.S. 145, 148 (1968). In the judgment of amici States , the right to
                                   keep and bear arms is " so rooted in the traditions and conscience of
                                   our people as to be ranked as fundamental." Palko v . Connecticut, 302

                                   overruled on other grounds , Benton v . Maryland , 395 U . S. 784 ( 1969),
                                   Authors of the Fourteenth Amendment concurred . See Van Alstyne,
                                   supra note 4, at 1252 (noting that in reporting the Fourteenth
                                   Amendment to the Senate , Senator Howard of Michigan described the
                                   right to keep and bear arms as among the Constitution' s "great
                                   fundamental guarantees " (internal quotation marks omitted)),
                                           A fortiori the Second Amendment applies to the District of
                                   Columbia. See District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co., 346

                                    II.    THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY HELD THAT
                                           THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FIREARMS
                                           REGULATIONS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

                                           This case concerns three ordinances that together
                                   effectively prohibit the private possession in one's home of
                                   any operative firearms. In an attempt to narrow the
                                   issues before the Court, the District tried to frame the
                                   question presented as concerning only its ordinance
                                   banning the private possession of handguns. Pet. i, 7 n.2.
                                     Tellingly, the District urged that "broadening the
                                   question to address the effect of Section7-2507.02 [the
                                   trigger-lock provision] would needlessly complicate the
                                   case ." Pet. Reply 6.
                                          The Court rejected that attempt, and instead
                                   reframed the question presented to consider the collective
                                   effect of all three challenged provisions of the D.C. Code,
                                   §§7-2502(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02.         Dist. of
                                   Columbia v. Heller,   128 S.Ct. 645 (2007) (mem.).
                                          Because the District's citizens cannot selectively
                                   abide by portions of its firearms prohibitions, but rather
                                   must comply with all of those prohibitions or face criminal
                                   penalties,' evaluating whether these statutes are
                                   constitutionally valid necessarily involves consideration of
                                   how they act together to restrict the constitutional right to
                                   keep and bear arms. Cf. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230
                                   (2006) (plurality op.) (concluding that a State' s campaign



                                   argument to the contrary-that D. C. is not a State whose militia is the
                                   object of the Amendment- is premised on it erroneous theory that the
                                   Second Amendment protects only collective, not individual , rights.

                                           7.   See D.C. CODE §§7-2507. 06;22-4515.

                                    contribution limits, taken together, unconstitutionally
                                    restricted a candidate's First Amendment rights);
                                    Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 34 (1968) (concluding
                                    that "the totality of the Ohio restrictive laws taken as a
                                    whole imposed a burden on voting and associational rights
                                    which we hold is an invidious discrimination, in violation
                                    of the Equal Protection Clause").
                                           The D.C. Code provisions at issue operate together
                                    as a unitary statutory scheme. D.C. Code §7-2502.02(a)(4)
                                    prohibits the registration of a pistol not registered in the
                                    District prior to 1976. Section 22-4504 separately restricts
                                    the carrying of a pistol, and is challenged in this case to
                                    the extent it bans individuals from moving lawfully
                                    registered handguns within their own homes, Pet. App.
                                    54a. Finally, §7-2507.02 provides in relevant part that a
                                    registered firearm must be kept "unloaded and
                                    disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device."
                                           Together, these provisions prohibit Mr. Heller from
                                    ever possessing, in his home, an operable firearm. In an
                                    attempt to temper the absolute nature of that bar, the
                                    District now contends that §7-2507.02 must be read to
                                    include an implied exception for self defense, even though
                                    the text of that provision contains not a word to that effect.
                                    Petitioners' Br. 56. Instead, the text is mandatory ("each
                                    registrant shall keep any firearm in his possession
                                    unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or
                                    similar device") and on its face contains no such
                                    exception.'



                                           8. Petitioners expressly acknowledge that , absent the ad hoc
                                   exception that they would like to engraft onto the plain text -"the law

                                                                 26

                                            In making that argument, Petitioners point to no
                                    precedent supporting the notion that an individual must
                                    risk criminal prosecution under a statute categorically
                                    restricting his or her constitutional rights, in the hope that
                                    a court might subsequently alter the text to protect those
                                    rights in some limited circumstances. And amici States
                                    are aware of none.
                                           Thus, the only fair reading of these ordinances'
                                    plain text is that together they operate as a sweeping
                                    prohibition on any effective exercise of the right to keep
                                    and bear arms in the District of Columbia.

                                                 Be Affirmed Because Statutes
                                                 Effectively Prohibiting Any Citizen

                                                 Unconstitutional.
                                          The court of appeals recognized that the individual
                                   right to keep and bear arms is not an absolute right
                                   immune from restriction. Pet. App. 51a. Rather, the court
                                   noted that the right to keep and bear arms, which pre-
                                   existed and was preserved by the Second Amendment, has
                                   traditionally been subject to "the sort of reasonable
                                   regulations contemplated by the drafters of the Second
                                   Amendment." Id. The court correctly concluded, however,
                                   that because the District's ordinances categorically
                                   prohibit the possession of functional firearms in private
                                   homes, they are unreasonable and unconstitutional.
                                                 1.     The D.C. Code provisions concern
                                                        "Arms" protected under the
                                                        Second Amendment.
                                         In evaluating the validity of the District's firearms
                                   prohibitions, the court of appeals adopted a two-part

                                                                 27

                                    test-drawn in part from this Court's opinion in
                                    Miller-that considered first whether the District's
                                    ordinances affected "Arms" protected under the Second
                                    Amendment . If the District's regulations affected only
                                    weapons that are not "Arms," they could not run afoul of
                                    the Amendment's protections. See id., at 48a-51a, 53a-
                                    55a. If, on the other hand, the regulations in question did
                                    affect "Arms ," the court would then move to the second
                                    part of the test : whether the regulations are "reasonable."
                                    See id., at 51a-55a.
                                          In determining whether the regulations affected
                                   "Arms" protected by the Second Amendment , the court of
                                   appeals followed the test set forth by this Court in Miller,
                                   under which a weapon is an "Armfl " if it: (1) bears a
                                   `"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency
                                   of a well regulated militia;"' and (2) is 'of the kind in
                                   common use at the time ."' Id., at 48-49a (quoting Miller,
                                   307 U. S., at 178-79). The court properly concluded that
                                   the handguns and long guns subject to the District's
                                   prohibitions meet both prongs of the Miller test and are
                                   therefore protected under the Amendment . Id., at 51a.
                                          As the court explained, "[t]he                 modern
                                   handgun-and for that matter the rifle and long-barreled
                                   shotgun-is undoubtedly quite improved over its colonial-
                                   era predecessor, but it is, after all, a lineal descendant of
                                   that founding-era weapon, and it passes Miller's
                                   standards." Id. In this regard, the court noted, just as the
                                   First Amendment protects "modern communications
                                   devices unknown to the founding generation ," the Second
                                   Amendment likewise protects the "modern-day
                                   equivalents" of colonial -era weapons . Id. Thus, while the
                                   court's test would properly include weapons such as rifles

                                    and handguns as protected "Arms" under the Amendment,
                                    a cannon, for example, would not be a protected "Arm"
                                    because it is not in common use by American citizens. See
                                    Pet. App. 50a-51a.
                                                 2.     The court of appeals correctly
                                                        concluded that the District's
                                                        statutes are unconstitutional.
                                           Having concluded that the District's restrictions
                                    implicated "Arms" protected under the Second
                                    Amendment, the court moved to the second part of its test
                                    and considered whether the District's statutes are
                                    "reasonable regulations." Id. at 51-52a.         The court
                                    observed that, "[t]he protections of the Second Amendment
                                    are subject to the same sort of reasonable restrictions that
                                   have been recognized as limiting, for instance, the First
                                   Amendment."         Id. at 51a.      The court specifically
                                   analogized to `"reasonable restrictions on the time, place,
                                   or manner of protected speech."' Id. (quoting Ward v. Rock
                                   Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989)), as the type of
                                   regulations that, in the Second Amendment. context, could
                                   permissibly restrict the right to keep and bear arms. Id.
                                   Under the Court's First Amendment precedent, of course,
                                   this type of restriction must be "narrowly tailored to serve
                                   a significant governmental interest," and must "leave open
                                   ample alternative channels for communication of the
                                   information." Ward, 491 U.S., at 791 (internal quotation
                                   marks omitted).
                                          Applying these principles, the court of appeals
                                   correctly recognized that the. District's statutes, which
                                   effectively forbid citizens from possessing handguns or
                                   operable long guns in their homes, are not really
                                   "regulations"of the right to keep and bear arms. See Pet.

                                    App. 53a. Rather, these statutes form a categorical
                                    `"prohibition, of ... "arms" which the people are entitled to
                                    bear."' Id. (quoting State v. Kerner, 107 S. E. 222, 225 (N.C.
                                    1921)). Accordingly, the court appropriately concluded
                                    that because these statutes essentially deprive all the
                                    District's citizens of their Second Amendment right to
                                    keep and bear arms, the statutes are not "reasonable
                                   regulations," but rather' facially unreasonable
                                   prohibitions. See id. But even if characterized as
                                   "regulations"-rather than outright prohibitions-the D.C.
                                   Code provisions are nonetheless unreasonable under
                                    Ward. The District justifies these statutes on the ground
                                   that they can be expected to "reduce crime, suicide,
                                   domestic violence, and accidental shootings." Petitio ners'.
                                   Br. 11. But although these asserted governmental
                                   interests are surely significant, its categorical ban on
                                   handguns-the most ubiquitous class of "arm" kept by
                                   citizens9-and on the possession of all operable long guns
                                   in the homes of anyone in the District, can hardly be
                                   described as a "narrowly tailored" statutory structure to
                                   serve those interests . Rather, these sweeping prohibitions
                                   leave no "ample alternatives" for the District's citizens to
                                   exercise their rights under the Second Amendment. Cf.
                                   Ward, 491 U.S., at 791.'0


                                           9. As the court of appeals observed, pistols are "the most
                                   preferred firearm in the nation to'keep ' and use for protection of one's
                                   home and family ." Pet. App. 53-54a (citing Gary Kleck & Marc Gertz,

                                   considered , amici States submit that the District's categorical ban on

                                                    States.
                                           The United States has advocated a standard of
                                    review that it believes is different from that applied by the
                                    court of appeals. U.S. Br. 23-24 & n.6. The United States
                                    therefore recommends that the Court should vacate and
                                    remand the case for further review under the United
                                    States's recommended "intermediate" level of review. Id.

                                          The United States's position cannot. bear scrutiny.
                                   Regardless of what test is applied-the court of appeals's,
                                   the United States's, or some other the District's
                                   categorical ban on all operable firearms cannot survive.
                                   Thus, a remand would serve no purpose.1'


                                           11. In Casey, 506 U. S., at 878-79, the Court adopted a new
                                   test for determining the constitutionality of restrictions on
                                   abortion-the undue burden standard-but rather than remanding,
                                   the Court applied the new standard to the provisions at issue.
                                   Similarly, in McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467,502 -03 (1991), the Court
                                   adopted the cause and prejudice standard for abuse of writ and
                                   affirmed the court of appeals's judgment under its newly -adopted
                                   standard.
                                          As Justice Stevens has explained , "[a]ppellate courts in
                                   general and this Court in particular have, after correcting an

                                                                     31

                                           The United States begins with the proposition that
                                    the Second Amendment "allows for reasonable regulation
                                    of firearms, must be interpreted in light of context and
                                    history, and is subject to important exceptions, such as the
                                    rule that convicted felons may be denied firearms." U.S.
                                    Br. 8. The court of appeals's decision is consistent with
                                    these principles. See supra Part II.A.
                                           The United States goes on, however, to set forth a
                                    different, "heightened" standard of review for regulations
                                    that "directly limitfl the private possession of `Arms' in a
                                    way that has no grounding in Framing-era practice." U.S.
                                    Br. 8. The United States acknowledges that the District's
                                    statutes directly limit "Arms" protected by the Second
                                    Amendment and have no grounding in "Framing-era
                                    practice." Id. According to the United States, this type of
                                    regulation is therefore subject to an "intermediate level of
                                    review," under which "the `rigorousness' of the inquiry
                                    depends on the degree of the burden on protected conduct."
                                    Id. Thus, under the United States's test, the greater the
                                    scope of the prohibition and its impact on private firearm
                                    possession, the more difficult it will be to defend under the
                                    Second Amendment. U.S. Br. 27.
                                          The United States's standard is derived from First
                                   Amendment election-law decisions that likewise instruct
                                   that the greater the restriction, the more exacting the
                                   scrutiny must be. See U.S. Br. 24 & n.6 (citing McIntyre
                                   v. Ohio Elections Comm n, 514 U.S. 334 (1995); Timmons
                                   v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351 (1997); and
                                   Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992)). The United
                                   States gives no reason why these election cases should


                                   application of a new legal standard in a particular case." Id.

                                                                     32

                                    provide the appropriate Second Amendment standard of
                                    review, but, if they were extended to do so, the District's
                                    ordinances would not survive.
                                           Indeed, under these cases, the District's sweeping
                                    prohibitions would likely be reviewed under strict
                                    scrutiny-a far more demanding standard than the
                                    "reasonableness" standard applied by the court of appeals.
                                    "Regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs' rights
                                    must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state
                                    interest." Timmons, 520 U.S., at 358; Burdick, 504 U.S.,
                                    at 433; McIntyre, 514 U.S., at 347.12
                                         And, by any measure, the District's categorical ban
                                   on possessing any operable firearms in his home must be
                                   viewed as a "severe burden" on Mr. Heller's Second
                                   Amendment rights. Thus, strict scrutiny would apply,
                                   which the District ordinances would necessarily fail.
                                          Even if the Court did not apply strict scrutiny, the
                                   District's statutes would also fail the (presumably
                                   alternative) less restrictive test set forth in the United
                                   States's brief. U.S. Br. 8. This test would evaluate the
                                   validity of the District's firearms prohibitions under the
                                   following standard: "(a) the practical impact of the
                                   challenged restriction on the plaintiffs ability to possess
                                   firearms for lawful purposes (which depends in turn on the
                                   nature and functional adequacy of available alternatives),
                                   and (b) the strength of the government's interest in


                                            12. In McIntyre- the case that the United States says best
                                   demonstrates the distinction between its proposed standard and that
                                   of the court of appeals , U.S. Br . 24 n.6-the Court applied strict
                                   scrutiny and struck down an Ohio electioneering law that prohibited
                                   the distribution of anonymous political documents . 614 U. S., at 344.

                                   enforcement of the relevant restriction."       Id.   Even
                                   assuming the important governmental interests
                                   articulated by the District, its firearms prohibitions
                                   cannot meet part (a) of the United States's test-which
                                   strongly resembles the "ample alternative channels for
                                   communication" standard set forth in Ward, 491 U.S., at
                                   791-because the District's prohibitions effectively leave
                                   its citizens with no alternatives regarding the possession
                                   of functional firearms in their homes for self-defense.
                                   Thus, even applying the test(s) suggested by the United
                                   States, the District's statutory scheme remains facially
                                   unconstitutional.
                                          C.     The Unreasonableness of the District's
                                                 Statutory Scheme Is Further Evidenced
                                                 by the Fact That It Runs Counter to the
                                                 Regulatory Approach ofAll Fifty States.
                                          To the extent the Court looks beyond the standard
                                   adopted by the court of appeals or those suggested by the
                                   United States, the unreasonable nature of the D.C. Code
                                   provisions is also evident when compared to the statutory
                                   approach of the fifty States.
                                          The Legislatures of all fifty States are united in
                                   their rejection of bans on private handgun ownership.
                                   Every State in the Union permits private citizens to own
                                   handguns." Forty-five States go further, allowing private
                                   citizens to carry concealed handguns for self-defense."
                                   Thus, the District's sweeping firearm prohibitions are not
                                   only contrary to the Constitution, but also contrary to the

                                                                34

                                    reasoned judgment of every state legislature in the
                                    Nation.
                                          Indeed, for that reason, this diverse coalition of 31
                                    amici States is of one accord that-under any
                                    standard-the District of Columbia's categorical ban
                                    cannot be sustained.
                                    III.   NONE OF THE FEDERAL FIREARMS REGULATIONS
                                           DISCUSSED IN THE UNITED STATES'S BRIEF IS
                                           JEOPARDIZED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS'S
                                           DECISION.

                                          The United States asserts that application of the
                                   court of appeals's standard would jeopardize the validity
                                   of a variety of federal firearms regulations. See U.S. Br.
                                   21-22, 25-27. This concern is misplaced.
                                          The federal firearms regulations that the United
                                   States suggests may be vulnerable fall into four
                                   categories: (1) restrictions on the type of firearms that may
                                   be possessed, (2) restriction on who may possess firearms,
                                   (3) restrictions on where firearms may be possessed, and
                                   (4) economic restrictions on the import, export, and
                                   exchange of firearms. See U.S. Br. 21-22, 25-27.
                                          In regard to the first category, the United States
                                   notes that federal law generally prohibits the possession
                                   of both machine guns and firearms that are undetectable
                                   by metal detectors and x-ray machines. U.S. Br. 2 (citing
                                   18 U.S.C. §922(o) (machine guns), (p) (undetectable
                                   firearms)). But neither of these regulations is impliedly
                                   invalidated by the court of appeals's decision.
                                         A court would likely conclude that machine guns
                                   and undetectable firearms do not constitute "Arms" under
                                   the Second Amendment. Even if these weapons could be

                                                                 35

                                    described as bearing a reasonable relationship to the
                                    preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, they
                                    could not be accurately categorized as the kinds of
                                    weapons that are currently in "common use" by American
                                    citizens . See Pet. App. 49a. And even if these weapons
                                    were considered "Arms," the federal laws would likely
                                    survive under the reasonableness standard because the
                                    regulations target a particularly dangerous feature of
                                    specific firearms and do not inhibit the core functionality
                                    of the general class of firearms.
                                           Second, the United States focuses on federal
                                   regulations addressing particular individuals who may not
                                   possess firearms . U.S. Br. 25-26 . Specifically, federal law
                                   prohibits possession of firearms by, inter alia, convicted
                                   felons , fugitives from justice , illegal drug users , mentally
                                   ill persons, illegal aliens, and those who have been
                                   convicted of domestic violence . 18 U.S. C. §922(g). The
                                   United States's concerns are unfounded because, as the
                                   court of appeals recognized-consistent with centuries of
                                   common law-prohibiting firearm possession by people
                                   with particularly dangerous characteristics is
                                   presumptively reasonable and constitutionally valid. Pet.
                                   App. 52a; see also Emerson, 270 F. 3d, at 264 (concluding
                                   that 18 U.S.C . § 922(g)(8) is a reasonable regulation).
                                          Third, the United States's fear of constitutional
                                   vulnerability concerning the federal restrictions on where
                                   a firearm may be possessed is equally unfounded. The

                                                                 36

                                    regulations of the right to keep and bear arms. Pet. App.
                                    51-52a.
                                          Finally, federal laws regulating the import , export,
                                    and transfer of firearms arise from Congress's power to
                                    "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the
                                    several States ," and have only an incidental effect on the
                                    Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As such,
                                    they would not be subject to heightened scrutiny.
                                          Accordingly, there is no basis for the United States's
                                   concern that these laws may face invalidation under the
                                   court of appeals's decision. Indeed , it bears emphasis that
                                   amici States likewise have a strong interest in
                                   maintaining the many state laws prohibiting felons in
                                   possession, restricting machine guns and sawed-off
                                   shotguns, and the like. See Appendix.
                                          But all 31 amici States agree that striking down the
                                   District of Columbia's categorical ban on all operative
                                   firearms would pose no threat to these reasonable
                                   regulations . Instead, this case is a threshold case : at issue
                                   is whether the Second Amendment has any modern
                                   meaning whatsoever.          Remaining faithful to the
                                   Constitution, there should be only one answer.
                                                           CONCLUSION
                                         The Court should affirm the judgment of the court
                                   of appeals.
