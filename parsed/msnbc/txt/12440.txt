                Governor, this is Bre. I am monitoring John's correspondence while he is out of the
                office.

                Upon reading your email, I spoke with Chuck Hamel and he indicated that he would
                be able to meet with you anytime after 1:30pm today - that's how long it would take
                him to get medically ready and travel to DC to meet with you. He promised that it
                would be a short meeting.

                If you could let me know a time that is truly convenient for you, I will relay that
                message to Mr. Hamel and try to set up an appointment for the two of you at the JW
                Marriott - if that is also convenient for you.

                He is awaiting my call with confirmation of a meeting time and place.

                I appreciate the opportunity to assist you in whatever way you deem necessary.

                Bre

                   Regarding a meeting with Chuck, he left a request on my office voice mail over
                   the weekend. He lives in Northern Virginia. He hasn't been in good health, but

                   I'm sure that he would make it to a DC meeting if you want him to do so.

                   If you are interested , we could contact him and try to set something up at the JW
                   Marriott.

                   Regarding your question concerning new developments, I think Chuck's basic
                   contention is that the State's regulators are unaware of several relevant
                   circumstances, as reported by Chuck's network of workers. The attached letter
                   to Congress seems to be a combination of situations where he alleges that the
                   State has misunderstood the consequences of certain events or was unaware of
                   them.

                   Senator Stevens has asked me to meet with him this morning on earmarking
                   policy and perhaps other issues. So , Larry and I will be out of the office for a
                   while beginning at 10 : 30. If you want to meet with Chuck, Bre can help arrange
                   a mutually convenient time.

                   Sam and I talked about events over the weekend. Privileged or Personal Material Reda
