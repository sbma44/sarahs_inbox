          Tonight's great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and still
          be successful. There's a Costco in Juneau, if you know what I mean. And my family is quite
          capable of setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

          Great idea!  Please all decide what is best for AGIA. But if time doesn't matter tonight
          is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.   Again
          decide what is best for AGIA. Tom
