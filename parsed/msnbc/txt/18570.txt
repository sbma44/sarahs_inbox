         Governor , the figures are state expenditures only. The Inaugural Committee reimbursed us
         for additional expenses relating to the inaugural balls that the state would not have paid
         for -- the total reimbursement was $4,007.20.



         I do not have the records for other money spent by the Inaugural Committee or money spent
         by the Palin family.

        Linda: Do these figures account for the Inaugural Committee and Palin family paying for
        travels?

         I'll have a copy printed for you in the office tomorrow.



         9-07-07



         Very preliminary information relating to prior administrations comparisons... we are still
         working through documents to sort out the travel information, including the public safety
         billings for flight charges.   The preliminary travel costs reflected here are for per diem
         reimbursements and commercial transportation expenditures only.



         Governor Palin days out of Juneau since taking office through 9/4/2007 are 173.



         The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this travel
         is $28,446.46 **NOTE: does not yet include public safety charges for any King Air Travel.




         Governor Murkowski's comparable timeframe comparison:

         Days out of Juneau from taking office through 8/24/2003 was 124.



        The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this travel
        was $18,553.32 **NOTE: no public safety charges yet included.. Governor Murkowski only had
        two trips with commercial airfare costs within this timeframe. There will be considerably
        more costs when the flight logs and billings are calculated.



         Prior administrations annual travel by calendar year without the public safety billing
         information:



        Gov. Murkowski

        Additional          2003 travel        70 days out of Juneau                  $17,571.16 cost

        2004                                     178 days out of Juneau                $29,213.13 cost

        2005                                    202 days out of Juneau                 $44,607.74 cost

        2006                                    193 days out of Juneau                 $52,065.79



        Additionally, Governor's Office maintained an apartment in Anchorage for Governor
        Murkowski from May 2005 through November 2006 at a rental rate of $900.00 per month.

        Good evening Governor,



        I've attached very PRELIMINARY information regarding our current costs

        as compared to prior administrations as requested in prior emails. We

        are still working through travel documents and will need to go through

        flight logs and public safety billings to obtain complete information.

        I hope to provide the full scenario by mid-week. We will also provide

        more detailed travel scenarios specific to Anchorage travel and costs

        that I believe will provide a more accurate comparison between the

                                                          4



                                                                                                       PRA_GSP01_0004611

         administrations.



         I apologize again for the delay Governor, but we still have a

         significant amount of documents to work through.



         If you think of any additional area of comparison, please let me know.



         Thank you,

         Linda

         Subject: Anchorage office



         How close are we to having the numbers showing #of days former Gov(s)

         spent out of Juneau compared to my travels/housing         expenses ?    The public

         deserves clarity on this as the misperception is I'm "living and

         working" in the Valley.       If, as Security and administrators tell me, Murk

         and Knowles also worked out of the Anchorage office and spent many, many

         days out of Juneau - then the fair comparison needs to be made and

         presented. The other missing point in the coverage of this issue is that

         the Anchorage office is the workplace.



        When I requested this info a couple of weeks ago I wasn't sure who was

        heading it up - please let me know as soon as possible who is and what

         the progress is. Thanks
