            Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request




            April 23 , 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green's request
            to expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin
            today outlined her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can
            show a path to success.



            House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial - birth abortion , and House Bill
            364, relating to parental consent, failed due to inaction by the Senate .    The Governor
            expressed disappointment that Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option
            during the regular session to move the legislation.



            "Alaskans know I am pro-life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of every
            human life ," Governor Palin said. " These issues are so important they shouldn't be
            diluted with oil and gas deliberations.



            Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently than

                                                                   1

             last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the full
             Senate.
