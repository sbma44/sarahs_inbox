         Joe and Mike have set up a briefing with House majority and minority members for next
         Tuesday at 10:30 in Anchorage. It was coordinated with Speaker Harris and Beth Kerttula.



         Based on my current understanding, it will be primarily a quick run through of the process
         we went through, the options we looked at, the type of analysis we did, and our
         conclusions.  We'll answer general questions, and offer more in-depth briefings for
         smaller groups in the following weeks.



         -Pat

         Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES. Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
         Majority going to ask for a similar briefing. If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
         deafening, Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.

            Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
          " details" of ACES before going all in.
