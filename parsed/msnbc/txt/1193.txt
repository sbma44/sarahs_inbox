   Subject : possible bill signing locations
  Hey guys,

  Here's a couple of ideas I Had for possible bill signings.

  HB 268 Motor Vehicle Arson on Public Land, Rep Stoltze
  He sponsored this bill after hearing from constituents about abandoned and shot up vehicles
  left at Jim Creek.
  Possible location : Butte Volunteer Fire Dept, or Knik Public Use Area
  Possible Invitees : State Fire Marshal DaveTyler, folks from the Butte Area Residents Civic
  Organization (BARCO) who asked Stoltze to sponsor the bill

  APOC bills : HB 281, HB 305, HB 368
  These bills could be signed at the same time at the APOC office to kill three birds with one
  stone. Possible invitees include bill sponsors Rep Lynn and Gatto (HB 281 Campaign
  Finance Disclosures), and Rep Meyer (HB305 Fundraising During Session). Rep Lynn's H
  STA committee also sponsored (HB 368 Ethics: Legislative & Gov/Lt Gov).

  HB 200 Workers ' Comp : Disease Presumption , Rep Dahlstrom
  This is the firefighters bill Gov Palin was supportive of. It establishes a presumption in the
  State's workers' comp program to allow benefits for firefighters who have a disease
  presumed to be caused by their occupation. Possible locations include ANC or Eagle River
  Fire Departments. Another bill of hers passed this session also-HB 286 Impersonating a
  public servant-that could be signed at the same time.
