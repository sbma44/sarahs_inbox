               Will do. Also in response to the emails about Lyda, I too think she should be called out
               on this. Her dishonesty shouldn't go unchecked... it'll be interesting what Frank
               discovers.

              I agree.  We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I think
              it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change. Tom

             room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
             streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
             understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

             Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to. her fundraiser. She's either lying
             again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
             lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
