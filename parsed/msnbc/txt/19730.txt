           There is still the misperception out there in the press that my sister is going through
           divorce proceedings and/or a custody battle. Not true-it's all been concluded... they've
           been divorced for some time now and the judge sided with Molly in the custody battle.
           (It's all the more reason to ask why I'd fire Walt for reasons pertaining to Wooten's
           personal life when it's impossible to fathom any reason to meddle is a closed case and
           potentially do harm to the party I allegedly sided with?)

              Another misperception by reporters is that the concerns over Wooten were recent, and
           were recently brought to Walt's attention (while I was governor). The concerns were
           outlined back in '05. I reminded Walt of them IN ANSWER TO HIS QUESTIONS about my need for
           security detail (as all governors are asked)... and the conversation with Walt was at the
           behest of the security detail personnel who asked that I share my safety concerns re:
           Wooten's outrageous threats with the DPS commissioner. I complied with their request, as
           did Todd (Bob Cockerall ahd asked Todd to bring to Walt's attention the concerns). This
           all happened early on.
