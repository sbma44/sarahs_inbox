                 To:       Governor Sarah Palin; Tibbles; Michael A (GOV)

                          (GOV)
                 Subject: DC Trip - Talking Points & Meetings
                  In preparation for your trip to DC, I have written the attached talking points
                  covering issues that may arise in your various meetings. The talking points
                  have been reviewed by agency personnel and others.

                  Separately, I will forward additional material prepared by members of the
                  Cabinet or their staffs in response to my request for assistance. The
                  preeminent issue for your non NGA meetings will likely be the gas pipeline,
                  and Joe Balash is working on talking points.

                  Below are suggested issues for those meetings which will not focus solely on
                  the gas pipeline.

                           Polar Bears/ ESA
                           Subsistence Management

                         etc.
                        Climate Change/Coastal Erosion/ Research
