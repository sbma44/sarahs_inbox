           I just gave a soundbite on this to our NGA media feed people. Dont know how that works,
           but they have the soundbite on Petroleum Intergity office positions being cut.

           These sentiments should be in a presser - the legislature is tearing the rug out of my
           efforts to prove our ability and committment to the oversight that' s needed before anyone
           can trust that ramped-up development of our resources should happen.

          Sharon- I ' m shocked and disappointed Chenault ' s taking out PSIO positions and BP corrosion
          lawsuit funds out of my budget . Im back here in DC speaking with Cneney ( sat with him the
          entire State dinner last night ), will try to speak w/Bush today ... speaking with national
          reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide sound oversight
          of resource development , as evidenced by P$IO , lawsuits to hold industry ' s feet to the
          fire re : waste of valuable natural resources , etc... and here while I ' m away I find out
          the legislature may undermine those efforts ? It's unacceptable if the nation is to
          believe we ' re capable of responsible , ethcial ramped up development that ' s need in our
          state , for our nation.
