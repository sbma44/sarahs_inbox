         Well, we'll take that "good history" memory of Mark's and utilize it for a good meeting
         with his folks!

        Mayor Mark is reaching a bit.. .never a co-chair that I recall, but I did label and stuff
        some envelopes for him in his first Assembly race around 1987 or 1989. Then, he and his
        brother, Tom, ran Pat Abney's campaign against me for state senate in 1996 when I beat the
        Begich Machine.  Guess he only remembers the good times. :)

          Talked to mark. He wants a mtg to address that list of items. The convo was fine. I told
          him we need DOT at that mtg if truly Anchorage is threatening to "turn off street lights"
          if we can't resolve who's to be paying what DOT bills... we need Talis there to address
          the DA office issues, and he's game for Sean Parnell's participation b/c he said Sean was
          co-chair of his first campaign, thus they have a good history. I told him I'll look at his
          list of concerns and I'll make sure all our appropriate folks are present (he's already
          thinking of his folks to bring).

          Just for a little more background, the Mayor is concerned that the prosecutorial
          discretion of the DA's office is leading to more plea deals. He claims the DA's office is
          so dysfunctional that there is high turnover and our new inexperienced assistant district
          attorneys are pleading out cases to lower offenses , leading to lower sentences .  He also
          claims that we are seeing the results of some of those plea deals, where an offender will
          be let off on a lighter sentence and subsequently reoffend on a more serious and violent
          offense.  He is implying that we are not doing our job keeping the dangerous criminals off
          the streets.   I have talked to Talis and asked his criminal section to pull together some
          research for us.   Also, he did make the same criticism before we were even here and I
          think he knows that our new head district attorney in Anchorage has only been on the job
          for one month.

           Usually a gov does not get in debates about such things, as the three branches of govt are
           to be respectfully separated. Good questions you're asking.



           And many of the knowles' appointees are the ones whom are angering mark, it seems.

          And perhaps this is a dumb question, but since when is the Governor responsible for
          sentences ? Judicial reviews and appointments, yes, but there is a separation for a reason.
          We can choose more conservative judges, but we can't randomly replace or ask for them to
          change sentences.



          You know, when this Mayor runs for higher office, it needs to be repeatedly pointed out
          that his biggest claim to fame of lowering taxes was only achieved by transferring the
          burden to the state , including so many items that he admitted could have been bonded but
          weren 't. Why don't our conservative legislators , including Harris , put that pressure on
          him?

          I'm calling him now so he won't claim lack of response. Talis is still perplexed, tho, why
          he hasn't returned his own call to the mayor. Talis is standing by...

          I think Begich placed a number of calls to us with different people. Once he heard from
          me, I think he lost interest in touching base with Talis. I was reminded by Talis'
          criminal deputy that the mayor was complaining about the same thing a year ago. The 175
          year sentence we just achieved on the Lord case is a good counter to the light sentence
          complaint.

         I'll find out before trying to reach Mark today.



         Talis waited all day on Friday for Mark to return his call. Why wouldn't Mark take
         seriously Talis' call, my availability with contact numbers, etc ...he'd better not be
         playing politics with something as significant as this.



         Also, I'm going to have Sharon correct Shelia Toomey re: replacing Bitney with two new
         staffers.  Both Bit and Chris Clark are being replaced with the two new staffers - it's
         not a two-replaces-one deal as the Ear made it sound.
