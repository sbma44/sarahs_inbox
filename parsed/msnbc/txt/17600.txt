        Good deal - and good luck to Ivy getting it passed! She's doing an awesome job getting
        the GOP gals on board. No surprise with Eileen, eh?

       This afternoon ,     the Alaska Federation of Republican Women resolution

       committee reported out (by a wide. margin )           the resolution Ivy took to

       the convention.       It will go to the floor for a vote at tomorrow's

       business meeting.



       There were two stinkers on the committee. One was Eileen (Murkowski)

       VanWyhe. The other was Eileen's best friend, Vicki Hill. The rest of

       the committee voted for the resolution.



       Colleen Sullivan-Leonard reports that there was a minor amdendment to

       the language, but otherwise it is moving as Ivy wrote it.



       Good news!



       Joe
