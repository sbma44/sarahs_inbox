          Steve and Tom Irwin are working on it. I haven't heard anything about the state kicking in
          $25million for Juneau- that would make no sense when Juneau is just tasting a bit of what
          rural, and Fairbanks, and other areas have been going through. Do you mind if I forward
          your email to the energy guys? I can't articulate how important I feel this issue is to be
          addressed... tax relief and doing something with our royalties to provide the resource
          owners (the people!) relief is top, top priority for me. Thanks- let me know if I may
          forward.

          I am sitting in the FAI airport waiting to see if I 'll be able to get a flight back home
          tonight. Thought I' d pass along some feedback from Fairbanks residents that will probably
          serve to confirm what you already know.



           1. Very hot environment on high energy costs.
