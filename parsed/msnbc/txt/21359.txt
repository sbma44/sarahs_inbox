             Oh man. Very good. Is there anything others can look at on the record to prove his
             hypocracy?

             Off the record...

            One of our friendly reporters has been listening to the house floor sessions on ppt during
            the murk administration where ramras was opposed to the ppt they were voting on and
            disgusted by the oil lobbyists he saw marching up to the gov's office. And he vowed that
            if he was tricked by the industry and their lobbyists when it came to this important tax
            policy then he would come back to jnu angry and pounding on the table demanding answers.
            Now today he says he doesn't know why he's here and doesn't think there is anything wrong
            w pptl What a flippin flip-flopper! What happened to the accountability in what you say
            and do?!? If this doesn't come out in a story (which I think it will) than I'm making sure
            it comes out in a letter to the editor.

             You're handling it very graciously-if I was pat I would have jumped over the table and
             strangled him. Who does jay think he is?!? He needs to shut his mouth, set his ego aside,
             and try and learn something. And another thing, if he's so upset about being in jnu during
             his "offseason" he shouldn't be a legislator!

             Pat,

             Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
             restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
             committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
             guys anyway I can!
