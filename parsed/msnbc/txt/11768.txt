             Blogs, Ear, the works.

             Feel free to let Alaskans know, all.

             Can't believe the Lt. Governor was surprised to discover this. That means others don't
             know either. Gotta spread the news. (But keep Lt. Governor's name out... He wouldn't want
             connection )
