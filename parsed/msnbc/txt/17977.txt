             Governor, Tom, Joe,
             Here's the interesting e-mail message from Kay Cashman at Petroleum News indicating that four
             reps of oil patch companies believe in AGIA!

            I was just visiting with some oil patch people who are thrilled AGIA passed as it did. They can't say much
            publicly, but they don't want another TAPS. One of the men said , 'We elected her (Gov. Palin) to get us a
            gas line deal that is gopd for Alaska, and by golly she's doing her job !' I was surprised that all four - from
            four different companies - were of the same mind.

            DEMOCRATS CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSION ON SENIOR CARE

            Assistance for thousands of Alaskans failed on multiple party-line votes



            JUNEAU - House Democrats sent a letter (attached) Tuesday evening to Gov. Sarah Palin urging her to make the restoration
            of Senior Care a priority for the fall special session. Efforts to continue providing critical assistance to thousands seniors were
            thwarted by House Republicans during the regular legislative session . Democrats will host a press conference in Anchorage,
            Fairbanks and Juneau at 11 a.m. Wednesday to discuss this important issue.



            House Democrats tried three times to prevent the cancellation of an important , monthly payment plan for low income seniors,
            Alaska Senior Care . That plan provides monthly payments to thousands , and is scheduled to end June 30. (See linked articles
            below).



            "This isn't an argument for politicians or partisans ," said House Democratic Leader Beth Kerttula. "This is about doing the
            right thing so more than 6,000 senior Alaskans don't have to choose between medicine and rent or between food and heat.
            When it's easy to do the right thing, there ' s simply no excuse to fail."



            "We should stand up for our seniors . Blocking votes on this issue isn't the kind of leadership Alaskans want," said Rep. Les
            Gara (D-Anchorage).

             House Democrats previously called for the fall special session to reform Alaska's oil taxes, and they hope the Governor
             will agree to add this issue to the special session call.



             Last Tuesday Democrats attempted to add funding to the budget to continue the current Senior Care plan for another year.
             That vote failed along party lines.



            The next day, on the final day of session, Democrats called for votes on two other bills that would have extended these senior
            payments. Democratic attempts to bring those bills to the floor were also killed on party-line votes.



            "This is not a controversial issue," said Rep. Max Gruenberg (D-Anchorage). "A poll shows that most Alaskans and more
            than 80 percent of the people in my district support assistance for seniors . Taking care of our seniors is an Alaskan priority."



            If Senior Care is restored during a special session payments would be continued, and could be made retroactive to July of this
            year to protect seniors who will stop receiving these payments on July 1.



            Rita Hatch from the Older Persons Action Group (http://www.onap-ak.ors/ ) will also attend the press conference.



            The press conference will take place in room 220 of the Anchorage LIO at the corner of 4th Ave and H. Reporters may call in
            at 1-888 -295-4546. Juneau reporters may attend in the office of Rep. Beth Kerttula in room 404 of the Capitol.
