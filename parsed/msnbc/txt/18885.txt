          You know, don't feel bad. You have A LOT of decisions to make on a daily basis. Your job
          would be impossible if you couldn't delegate. You did the right thing, and thought this
          was in someone else's hands. There's no fault in that. I still think you did all you could
          do-this thing will work itself out. You're awesome.

          Thank you so much for doing that Ivy. It's a bummer to hear of the lack of comm that I
          thought we had mapped out... at least I assumed it was happening. Your talk with Kyle will
          go a long way - I appreciate you doing that.

          Just so you know, I didn't commit you to anything. I listened for the most part which is
          sometimes better than talking. I personally think you made the best decision for the state
          of alaska re: gravina and the majority of akns agree.

           Talked to kyle and conveyed you were sympathetic to the way he found out and that you had
           no intentions of springing anything on him or his constituents . He's pretty frustrated but
           the good thing is he ended the conversation by saying he'd stay out of the press for a
           while.

           Specifically , he's mad about a couple of things:

           1 he was caught off guard and found out via the press release

           2 the presser was sent at Sam and it has the appearance that it was sent at that time to
           catch natl interest

           3 he spent 4 days in skagway w dot officials who never once mentioned this to him

           4 the quote from dot in the press release that talks about the ferry system being a drain
           on the state ( or words to that effect)

           5 dot requested ktn come up w cheaper alternatives to the current bridge project and ktn
           has beenworking on that request , then dot says the original bridge funds will be spread
           out across the state instead of staying in ktn-in sum , it was kind of like, if the money
           isn't going towards the bridge it could still be used on other projects in ktn.

           I have the sense he's most upset w dot, although he inferred he was upset by the way he
           found out - he would have liked to hear from the administration.

           I told him I wasn't in a position to offer anything but I did sincerely apologize for the
           way he found out. I told him I knew you both before you were elected officials and I just
           want to find a way for us all to move forward on a positive note . He was appreciative of
           this. I told him I would convey his msg to you and that we'd go from there. He said he'd
           call me tomorrow from anc after I talked to you.

           Without knowing all of the ins and outs, he's pretty upset leo won't return his phone
           calls. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
          Privilege



          Atleast he ' s going to stay out of the news-i thought that was a positive

            step. Hope this helps!!!

           Ps me and bri are playing phone tag .    I'm going to run out that way later today and try and
           find the girls.

          came across as being defensive !  You guys are doing a great job as I recognize our full
          plates , limited resources and number of personnel ... I recognize that.

           have fun , doggone it.

           Thank you guys.

           measures we're taking to help.

          Kyle was traveling until yesterday early afternoon .    I left a message for him first thing
          in the morning but he did not call back until about 2 : 00.  I was able to reach Bert early
          in the morning and he even admited to me that he knew the announcement was coming two days
          ago.  Even though Leo made his comments at the Ketchikan Chamber and were covered widely
          by the news , they still argued that we were not clear. Bert restated this when I called
          him back yesterday afternoon.



           I talked to Mayor Williams yesterday and he requested a meeting with you preferably in
          Ketchikan but he said he could travel if that was not possible.

           Mike / Russ /Randy: Holy moly - Kyle Johanson' s comments are as biting as Bert Stedman's
          were (in adn this morning ). When did you guys talk to them - when the presser was first
          crafted on Monday? Why do they say they were shocked yesterday?

           Bert didn't sound as angry as "shocked" when I talked to him yesterday, but even that
          surpsrised me because I'm assuming this was communicated to him at the beginning of the
          week.



           Also, as Sharon knows, the Stevens story grew legs NOT out of any "demand" I made for him
          to talk to Alaskans, as KTUU reported last night. When asked three times in two days by
          different reporters if I thought Stevens should talk about the investigation, I did say I
          thought Alaskans want to hear any information he can provide, and it's appropriate and
          deserved to give him the benefit of the doubt - and Alaskans get frustrated when he can't
          or isn't providing information on his innocence.



           It's very clear the adn reporter made my comments sound more inciteful than necessary. AP
          report was more in context, but the headline was rough. I'm not "demanding" Stevens do
          anything, just as I'm not "demanding" state senate leadership strip Cowdery of Rules - I
          won't tell anyone what to do and I don't have the authority to do so anyway. These
          questions have been impossible to avoid and I'll continue to give my opinion, but it's
          unfortunate the Stevens comment is made to sound more controversial than I intended.
