          THCC and here you did it. I printed it out for Emma and hopefully she can

            Subject: Acknowledgement; thank you ANS Camp 2!




            I am extremely fortunate to have been able to be part of this women's

            conference and was could not have done it without the following: Diane

            Carrier, Sarah Lampe, my brother William, my sister Laura Sheldon and Myrna

            Foster. These people are continually stepping forward to make things happen

            for others. ANS must be proud of sister Sarah Lampe, Grand Camp Sargent At

           Arms who made a trip over to help and who also brought the seal meat that

            everyone enjoyed Saturday! I acknowledge President Micalyn Kunz McGhee and

           her sister Nelly who were very much a part of this picture; they are true

           inspiration of what ANS is all about. Thank you Connie for your continued

           respect and for checking on items that needed to be done; you and Emma

           really shined. I truly love my mom and after hearing her speak will make

           more time for this wonderful lady so she can expect visits from me. I am

           glad she is up front and personal; you learn from the best. Last but

           certainly not least I would like to personally acknowledge President Martin;

           it is a blessing to be working under his leadership. His genuine concern

           and support for Elders, youth, family, ANB/ANS and Southeast Native Veterans

           shows his commitment in making our organization a good one.



           I apologize for not making it in Saturday but had 9 grandchildren I was

           caring for. Our day ended after the free swim for them after 8 PM.

                                                           2

           I want to take this time and remind everyone that the last Native Issues

            Forum is scheduled for April 9th; Senator Kookesh and Representative Bill

           Thomas. MC Ron Williams. Our menu plans include entree items of Roast

           w/gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cream style corn, spaghetti w/sauteed

           onions, green peppers and celery, buttered dinner roll. Dessert: Cake

           w/strawberry filling. Pork noodles, bac-o salad, macaroni salad, fruit salad

            and hopefully fresh herring egg salad if it arrives in time from Sitka
