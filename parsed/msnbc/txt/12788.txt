             Governor - the Iditarod is inquiring on whether you can congratulate the winner again this
             year.  The unfortunate aspect is the time. They're now estimating that the race will
             finish between midnight - 2 a.m. tomorrow (Tues night/Weds morning).    They would call
             you at whatever number we provide. Looks possible to be Mackey again.

            At this point , I am estimating a finishing time of midnight - 2 a.m. tomorrow (Tuesday
            night - Wednesday morning ).  As you know , the live television finish script ( broadcast
            live on Channel 2 and streamed worldwide on iditarod . com) includes the Governor
            congratulating the race winner.




            This will take place 33 minutes from the time that the winner crosses the finish line.
            Assuming that the Governor wishes to participate ( we hope so, even at the odd hour!) we
            will need a phone number that we can call.




            I can be reached at 907 . 232.8730.
