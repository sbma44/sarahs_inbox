              Governor - Meg just emailed me with the request for an Interview with Investor' s Business Daily with                           i
              Reporter Monica Showalter (15 min.) Regarding AGIA Kurt Gibson would be available to join you also.
              These must be the talking points for that Interview request. We just need to pick a time. Janice

              Governor,

              My sincerest apologies. I forwarded to Sharon an outdated copy of the national talking points earlier
              today. Attached is the latest with the most recent. It is all the same information as you had last week for
              Kudlow, with the exception that we added an AGIA section toward the top of the document and then
              potential AGIA questions under that section, too.

              Thank you: And again, my apologies. Kurt had to slap me up-side the head tonight before I realized what i
              had done!

              Meg
