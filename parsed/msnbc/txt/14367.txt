             I can't read it- but I certainly support you filing an unfair labor practice measure if
             they're messing with Joe and his ability to do his job in protecting Alaskans.

             Governor & Mike:

             I know you usually are viewing emails through your blackberry - so the

             gist of the attachment is advising ACOA that its actions with regard to

             Commissioner Schmidt bring it close to unfair labor practices. If it

             doesn't cease, I will file an unfair labor practice. This letter is

             signed by the Division Director, but if I file an ULP, I will sign it,

             ratcheting up the response.       Commissioner Schmidt has been provided a

             copy.

             ak

             Brad, I just tried to reach you by phone to discuss the attached.               I'll

             plan to talk with you on Monday.
