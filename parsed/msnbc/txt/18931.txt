          Back in August, we were told by PFC that they decided not to hold an annual dinner at the
          annual meeting this year. That meant that the traditional announcement venue wouldn't
          occur. Because of that, we were told it was up to the Governor and Revenue how the
          announcement would be made. I told them we would figure out a venue and make the
          announcement.   The plans for a September 19 announcement proceeded from there. It was the
          last I heard from PFC, and I never got the impression that they felt slighted or had an
          alternative venue.



          The meeting starting tomorrow is in Fairbanks. I see on the agenda that they have a
          "community reception" scheduled for Monday at 6, with "dinner on own" after that. I'll
          check with PFC staff to see what may be the source of the Ear comment. If it seems
          appropriate, I'll ask someone to contact Toomey with a correction.

          Governor,



          Received now. I was not aware of any need or discussion to hold it in Fairbanks.



          I read the Ear story today suggesting that the announcement was originally scheduled to
          take place in Fairbanks tomorrow. That is news to me. It had been scheduled by Revenue
          for last week.

           Pat and Mike- in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd, I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks, and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event "out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate, and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea, I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past, except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate, hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.

           If this was "hijackiing" it or it was out of line, surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
