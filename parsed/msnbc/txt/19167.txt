        Bottom line - what am i being asked to do about thin, and please present a rrcommendation
        through COS that can be based on thorough investigation of the situation.

        Joe - i have so many questions on this I don't even know where to start and I'm in the
        middle of ASAA activities today... but let me shoot off the questions and I'll cc others
        who may have the answers.



        First: is the rumor true (if not we're wasting our time)?



        Has the COS been informed, and Communications people, so I can be presented factual info
        and I can pro-actively be ready with a statement?



        Where's the PSIO and DNR on this?



        Many more questions... I'll stand by for answers to these first though.

         Pat Galvin got an email early this morning from Tom Wright's wife on the same subject.
         Either he told her the same thing that he told me, or their source is the same person. In
         that case, I would suspect that person is their son.

        Who?



        See, it will be important to know the legitimacy of this rumor so our overseeing agency
        can be properly prepared.

        It was third-hand. A former staffer with a buddy on the Slope told me. His contact is
        somebody at BP that's up there. . .and the BP person learned of it this afternoon.

        Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
        fixes...

        I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M Hill that are currently under contract
        with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
        than 100 people . An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
        informed.  The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
        winter work.  Sorry I don't have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand
        just a few minutes ago.
