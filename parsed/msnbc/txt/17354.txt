             Subject : Longevity Bonus

           Just watched on Gavel to Gavel as Rep Nelson offered an amendment to include Longevity Bonus funding In the
           operating budget. She said she was doing it "to honor the governor 's request." The amendment failed 6-4, but I
           still thought it was awesome.
