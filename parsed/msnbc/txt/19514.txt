                Mission

                To foster the development of the arts for all Alaskans through education,
                partnership, grants and services.



                A Note From Charlotte:

                First off, I want to apologize for the non graphics on this newsletter. We are
                between newsletter graphics contractors, and wanted to get this out in a
                timely manner.

                As you may know, the Council awarded over $500,000 in annual and quarterly
                grants at their meeting in June. We received $40,000 increment in state
                general funds for FY 09, and this marks the 6th year that we have received an
                increase, and we hope this trend continues. Of course, a critical part of this
                funding is the recognition that each of you give to your elected officials about
                their support. I urge you to personally invite legislators to your openings, events,
                recitals, or even your studio! They need to know that we appreciate their
                support.

                I also want to make sure each of you puts an important date on your calendar:
                January 29-31, 2009. That will be the dates of the statewide arts conference in
                Anchorage. We will be sending out some particulars in September, but please make
                sure it's in your budget. There are also some travel grant possibilities for you to

                and the Rasmuson Cultural Leadership grant.

                I had the privilege of visiting Ketchikan in May, and the Ketchikan Area Arts and
                Humanities Council has met their fundraising goal to purchase new digs for their
                offices and activities. It's an amazing community down there - one of many creative
                communities in Alaska. ASCA also had our annual meeting in Homer, splendidly
                hosted by the Homer Council on the Arts, with a dinner, reception and other
                activities. Our thanks to Hope Finkelstein, Diane Borgman and the HCOA Board,
