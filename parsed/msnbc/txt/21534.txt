                ECS Launches One-of-a-kind, Nationwide High School
                Databases to Boost Efforts by State Policymakers

                DENVER, CO -- Today the Education Commission of the States (ECS) goes live with three high
                school databases to assist state policymakers with questions about International Baccalaureate,
                student accountability, and student support and remediation. ECS also launches an updated
                database on promising local reform initiatives at the state and district level from around the
                country.

                "These databases address emerging or peaking issues for state policymakers," ECS High School
                Policy Center Project Manager Jennifer Dounay said. "For instance, many states are concerned
                with dropout prevention and how to help young people drop back into the system after they've
                dropped out. The student support and remediation database helps policymakers assess what work
                is being done across the states to tackle this issue, along with a host of related topics."

                   While Advanced Placement has been on policymakers' radar for some time, Dounay noted that many
                   states have only recently begun to consider establishing similar supporting policies for International
                   Baccalaureate (IB), a program growing in demand in the U.S.

                   The IB database (www.ecs.org/hsdb-ib) is the only national database of its kind. It describes a
                   framework of model supports for the program including where states provide additional funding to
                   support IB course costs, teacher training, accountability incentives, test-fee subsidies and more.

                   A second database provides a unique view of how each state, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
                   holds students accountable (www.ecs.or sdb-sa). It updates policymakers on the upper compulsory
                   school age for students along with policies that take advantage of students' desire to drive (no pass/no
                   drive) and participate in sports as a "carrot" for attendance and school performance (no pass/no play).

                   The third database shows how state policies across the nation support early identification of students
                   who have fallen behind in core academic areas (www.ecs .or sdb-ss). It features state policies that
                   proactively support those at risk of dropping out as well as policies that support students who desire to
                   drop back into a high school diploma program . This database also identifies states that require individual
                   learning plans for students in need.

                   The local high school reform initiatives database (www.ecs.org/hsdb-li) highlights promising state- and
                   district-level reforms that are producing outstanding results, most in place for at least three years.
                   According to Dounay, these reforms are bold, innovative and can be replicated by other districts and
                   states.

                                                                      ###

                   Senate Passes 7-Year Internet Tax Moratorium
                   The U. S. Chamber of Commerce applauded the Senate for passing a tax
                   moratorium on Internet purchases and access for seven years before the
                   current moratorium expired on November 1. The House will now consider the
                   Senate legislation , which goes further than the recently approved House bill
                   to extend the moratorium for four years. The Chamber supports a permanent
                   ban on Internet taxes.

                   Read the Chamber's latest letter.
