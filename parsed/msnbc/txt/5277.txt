               We've given the amendment to Senate Judiciary for inclusion in the Governor 's bill.
               The House subcommittee will take up their version this week.

               It will appear this week ... my prediction

                           TO: Governor Sarah Palin                                DATE: 2/20/07
                         FROM: Joe Balash                                     TELEPHONE: 907-465-4022

                     SUBJECT: Briefing paper regarding meeting with the Alliance on 2/21/07

                    Founded in 1979, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance represents companies and
                    organizations that provide goods and services for Alaska's oil, gas and mineral
                    industries. There are 400+ member companies who provide 30,000 Alaskan jobs. The
                    Alliance is a 501(c)(6) trade association and has chapters in Anchorage, Fairbanks and
                    Kenai.

                    The Alliance hosts the annual Meet Alaska conference and trade show in Anchorage -
                    which you addressed in January. They conduct an annual Juneau fly-in, which is why
                    they are in Juneau this week. They also engage in direct lobbying on industry issues.
                    Last year, they were able to generate significant pro-industry testimony during the
                    hearings on PPT and will likely play a leading role in testimony on AGIA. As an
                    organization, they support a highway project as opposed to an LNG project.

                    Their 2007 Legislative Priorities are:

                    1. Legislative Approval of a Gas Fiscal Contract which:

                                  Encourages earliest possible construction of a pipeline

                                  Promotes use of Alaskan contractors and suppliers

                                  Guarantees fair and open competition for pipeline work

                                  Provides for in-state access to supplies

                                  Ensures 3rd-party access and expansion capability

                    2. No reconsideration of PPT adopted in 2006

                    3. Promote a positive business climate for oil and gas reinvestment

                                  They cite the need to reinvest $60 billion over the next 10 years to sustain
                                   base production and pursue new exploration and development

                    4. Fiscal Responsibility - advocates for a fiscal plan now, while surpluses are in effect




                                                                                                              PRA_GSP01_0000313

                    5. Support legislation that promotes the development of a highly skilled and globally
                    competitive resident Alaskan workforce that will meet the current and future needs of
                    the oil, gas and mining industries.

                    6. Oppose any legislation pre-empting or undermining the regulatory and permitting
                    process for the Pebble Mine project.



                    The Alliance is governed by a 14-member board of directors with 5 executive officers.
                    The president of the organization is Jim Palmer, a private consultant who previously
                    worked at BP. One of his leading clients is Pioneer Oil. The executive director is Paul
                    Laird, former spokesman for BP.

                    These board members are likely to be very sympathetic to the arguments put forward
                    by the Producers on AGIA. You may even get some criticism with regard to your
                    comments on Exxon, Point Thomson, and the content of your speeches. Don't let them
                    lay blame at your doorstep. Make sure they understand that you have met with the
                    Producers, you have asked them to participate constructively in the formation of AGIA,
                    and their response has been to try and get you back off. Looking at their state
                    priorities/ goals for a fiscal contract, you share many of the same goals. AGIA is
                    designed to accomplish each of those: early construction, Alaska hire, in- state use,
                    competition for jobs, and access for explorers.
