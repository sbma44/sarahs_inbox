             Yep- heading to Juneau in a bit here.



             Marty may be assuming there's a different approach to Judge Troissi's ruling, so I want to
             make sure she knows you've already communicated with Barnhill and there's a path you're
             on. Tom speaks to a Chamber tomorrow about Pebble, so they're anxious to know of any
             movement that could/should/has been made in reaction to tomorrow's deadline re:requesting
             any stay.



             Do you want to cc her and Tom in to our emails on this - with Talis also?

               Very good Sean.



              Have you communicated this to Tom and Marty? I'm not sure they have all the info you have
             that led to any recent decisions.

              Dear Mike,




              I am taking the liberty of e-mailing you because today is a state holiday and I assume
             your support staff is not working and so I could not be able to call you. I drafted most
             of this message before getting the order just issued by the court which orders us to do
             what I suggest below.




              This message is motivated by the filing you faxed to us at 4:08 pm last evening. As you
             can imagine my clients are very disappointed that the Lieutenant Governor has decided that
             he cannot comply with the court order.




               My clients believe that by a) delaying the decision to not certify the initiative until
             virtually the last day of the 60 days allowed, b) refusing to agree to our proposed time
             for filing his answer, c) seeking additional time to respond to our motion for summary
             judgment (which we agreed to) d) taking virtually the entire 60 days to address 07WTR2,
             e) the ongoing delay in addressing the validity of 07WTR3 which was revised to
             accommodate the states concerns, f) the failure of the state to object to the five day
             period we had in our proposed order g) the failure to take any action for two days after
             the court order was received,  and h)  the insistence that the petitions cannot be made
             available until the 29th of this month at the earliest, that the Lt. Governor has
             deliberately and intentionally delayed any approval of a ballot measure which might
             be related to large scale mining in Alaska for policy or political reasons .   They feel he
             is trying to keep the people from having the opportunity to vote on such a measure.    And
             they feel at this point that he has admitted he is in contempt of court. They have
             instructed us to seek an order to show cause and to compel sanctions. They are also
             exploring other methods to communicate their considerable frustration.




              Given the dates on the Division of Elections web page showing that petition books for
             numerous other initiatives have been provided in much less than 17 days they do not
                                                            7




                                                                                                       PRA GSP01_0006866

             believe that 17 days should be necessary .  The specific procedures outlined in the
             statutes and regulations do not require that much time .  The drafting of a summary and the
             preparation of a cost estimate should not take long. While petition books have to be
             printed we believe that would it would not take 5 calendar days to get those printed.
             Indeed experts in printing we have consulted with think that numerous print shops could
             produce at least 100 booklets overnight.   And I note that the rules permit the applicants
             to pay for additional booklets to be printed if they think the Lt. Gov. has not provided
             enough.




              I am contacting you to explore the possibility of resolving this short of us asking the
             court to hold Mr.. Parnell in contempt and that significant fines and other sanctions be
             imposed.




              It would seem that with a few hours of concentrated effort by the Division of Elections,
             the summary and the cost estimate could be completed.    The layout of the booklet should
             take only a few more hours. Printing could be started and the first several hundred
             booklets should be available within in a day after that.    Alternatively perhaps agreement
             could be reached on interim booklets that could be copied on copy machines and could be
             used to gather signatures before the final booklets are printed .  It does not seem that we
             need to engage in a huge legal battle if a bit of cooperation could resolve the timing
             issues .  It may require a bit of flexibility on the part of the state and officials of
             the Division of Elections . But it does not appear that there are specific time frames in
             statute or other similar legal requirements that must be observed at the risk of
             challenges from others.




              In short I urge you in the strongest possible terms to get with your client        and his staff
             in the Division of Elections and come up with a way that can accelerate this        process and
             avoid the delay which you are now proposing and which is unacceptable to my         clients. My
             clients may even be willing to help cover some of the costs if it means they        do not have
             to pay me to pursue expensive litigation against the state.




              Can I hear from you no later than 10 am tomorrow ? If we do not have a solution in place
             by noon tomorrow or very significant progress towards a solution , I am instructed to file
             a motion for order to show cause and to ask for significant financial and other sanctions.
