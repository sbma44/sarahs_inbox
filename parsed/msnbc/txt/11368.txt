                 Dear News Folks & Governor Palin,

                Aren't you getting just a bit tired of the space given to Sarah's beauty?
                It was stale weeks ago, and yet it seems that her beauty still makes the
                headlines. Talk about FLUFF reporting. Lets try some serious political
                journalism. Try talking about real life! Newsworthy subjects that are
                interesting, informative and could actually be productive.

                Did Ak Magazine pay you guys to promo the upcoming issue?

                I have NEVER seen such sexist reporting, or promoting. You are supposed
                to be a NEWS paper, not the society page. Have you ever printed an
                article about how good looking and cute Tony Knowles is.. or any Governor
                we ever had? Why doesn't Lisa Murkowski get to have feature articles
                and editorials written about her beauty and hot looks? (Ok, maybe that is
                because she doesn 't have any... I'll bet she is jealous that you give the
                attention to Sarah while she is the wallflower that isn't even noticed
                unless she is taking a favor or bribe.....)

                We might as well have a calendar published of Sarah for the guys to
                mount on the wall of all the state Dept. of Hwy. repair shops and
                janitorial storage closets.... just like the WWII pin-ups . Maybe one of
                the "First Guy" for us gals too? (He is a hunk.)

                Come on, lets get off this "Hot Gov." kick and have the space given to real
                news . Let our Governor do her job, without the distraction usually
                produced by adolescent boys.

                 THE GOVERNOR OF OUR GREAT STATE - CAN HOLD HER OWN IN A DEBATE

                 SHE HAS A MIND THAT'S QUICK AND SHARP - HER POLITICS SHE WILL IMPART

                 WITHOUT A "GOOD OLD BOY" REVIEW - THAT TELLS HER WHAT SHE SHOULD "PUSH THROUGH"

                 YES, IT IS A NOVELTY - TO HAVE A WOMAN SUCH AS SHE



                 BECAUSE HER VIEW IS FRESH AND CLEAN - FROM OIL THERE IS NOT A SHEEN

                 INFLUENCE HERE THAY CANNOT PANDER - THE "GOOSE" DOES NOT ACT LIKE THE GANDER

                 THE MEN THAT ALL HAVE SERVED BEFORE - WERE NOT SWOONED OVER, NOR ADORED

                 BY FEMALE WRITERS OR NEWS HOUND - THIS GENDER THING , I HAVE FOUND



                 MAY BE DESIGNED AS A RED HERRING -SO WE DON'T SEE HOW SHE'S FARING

                 WITH HER RUNNING OF THE STATE - ALL IN ALL WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT

                THE FOCUS SHOULD BE GOVERNMENT - NOT THE LOOKS THAT HEAVEN SENT

                REMEMBER MEN ARE LITTLE BOYS - WHO LIKE TO BICKER OVER TOYS

                BE THEY BIG OR BE THEY SMALL - THEY WANT TO BE IN CHARGE OF ALL

                  Her beauty's said to mesmerize,

                  It clouds the brains of all the guys.

                  The chicks say that' s a bunch of bunk,

                  But First Dude ... He's a Super HUNK!

                  It fakes you out and hurts like hell...

                 But in the end, it comes out well.

                 There is nothing that she can 't transcend.

                      tonnes. According to the report's author, consulting firm Frost & Sullivan,
                      waste management In Europe is no longer a haulage and disposal
                      business. Legislative shifts of the past decade have driven the adoption of
                      advanced technology and innovative recycling solutions. Despite the
                      importance of recycling and waste minimization, waste-to-energy is seen
                     as the only viable large scale alternative to landfills. The high capital costs
                     required and complex energy partnerships involved are driving a shift
                     away from traditional public ownership of the plants in favor of industry
                     privatization. It also explains why there are only about 200 to 250 players
                     In the sector (as of 2007) compared with other waste management
                     segments. According to Frost & Sullivan's John Raspin, "It is inevitable
                     that we will see further consolidation of the market and that investors
                     from a whole range of backgrounds will continue to be drawn to this
                     sustainable growth market.".. Read More »

                     FACILITIES
                     New Jersey Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and others gathered to announce
                    the enactment of a one -year provision that allows states and
                    municipalities to force cleanup of solid waste facilities along rail lines
                    which had previously been exempt from state and local regulation. Up
                    until now such "transloading " facilities by virtue of their association with
                    the railroads, have avoided the Increased costs and environmental
                    controls required under state and local regulation . As a railroad they are
                    regulated by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) under the
                    Department of Transportation , which preempts state and local laws. Under
                    Senator Lautenberg , Congress has been moving to close this unintended
                    loophole by crafting specific legislation called the Clean Railroads Act of
                    2007 which alms to make the provision permanent . Without the provision,
                    the courts and federal agencies had little choice but to uphold the
                    exemption of these rail -based transloading facilities . In New Jersey

                 4. WHITE BIRCH PAPER ACQUIRES SP NEWSPRINT FOR $350M
                    SP Newsprint Co, a privately held producer and recycler of newsprint, said
                    it agreed to be bought by affiliates of Peter Brant, who is the controlling
                    shareholder of White Birch Paper Co, for $350 million in cash. SP
                    Newsprint is owned in an equal, general partnership by affiliates of Cox
                    Enterprises Inc, Media General Inc and The McClatchy Co. McClatchy
                    recently acquired the even larger Knight-Ridder newspaper chain requiring
                    considerable debt. White Birch is the second largest producer of newsprint
                    in North America. SP is the fifth largest producer of newsprint and the
                    second largest producer of 100 percent recycled newsprint. SP produces
                    about 1 million metric tons annually for which it generated sales of $638
                    million in 2006, the latest year for which figures are available. Industry
                    consolidation is being driven in part by a declining newsprint market from
                    lower newspaper demand, which fell 20 percent in 2006. But, economies-
                    of-scale are at work too.. . Read More))

                    WASTE TO MAINLAND
                    For now it appears that O 'ahu, Hawaii will abandon plans to build a new
                    waste-to-energy facility and will instead add a third boiler to its H-Power
                    waste -to-energy plant . The third boiler could be added relatively quickly,
                    by 2011 , and would cost $100 million less than a new facility . Mayor Mufi
                    Hannemann also announced plans to ship excess waste to the mainland as
                    early as next year . The primary goal is to reduce dependence on the
                    controversial Waimanalo Gulch near Kahe Point. H-Power currently
                    employs 2 huge boilers that collectively burn 600 thousand tons of waste
                    per year and generate 46 megawatts of electricity . The resulting ash

                    Elliott landfill is the new $29 million Cefe F. Vaienzuela landfill 12 miles
                    away. It opened on October 28 with a permitted capacity of 130 million
                    cubic yards. The transfer station is expected to reduce travel time and fuel
                    costs by keeping the heavy collection vehicles off the expressway. Elliott
