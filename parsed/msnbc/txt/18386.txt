            OK, I just got logged back in. My cell died overnight.

            I will follow up to make sure the judges are moved and notified they will be participating in a phone interview. I
            will plan on staying in Anchorage well.

            Since Monday is a holiday, thursday and friday are our best days to brief legislators on the direction we are
            going. I am hopeful that we can work out final detail with you today and start our disucssions with legislators
            tomorrow. We still need to put together the talking points, charts, etc. The data should speak for itself, so the
            charts and talking points should not be too difficult. We should focus on the appropriate revenues to the state as
            well as maintaining a positive environment for new companies to come explore, invest and develop our resources.

            This afternoon, can we spend time finalizing where we are at?

            Mike

           J- i can't be absent from ppt debate tonight and tomorrow - I'll have to conduct judges interviews via telephone. Mike can
           help with the re-arranging of Rep Thomas' mtg- I'm wondering if he can fly up here tonight or tomorrow if his mtg can't wait
           until my travels down there next wk.

           Pis don't schedule anything after the judges interviews tomorrow - I'll need to keep it clear for internal gross/ppt "convincing
           debate/discussions" with the team and then legislators.

           Mike- I may ask revenue/oil folks to come for casual dinner at my house thursday night for fuller explanations of where they
           think we should go on ppt/gross. I'll ask Kris to help me with that. This is the most imp roll-out we'll engage in... if we're not
           all on the same page, then we're doing Alaskans a major disservice.

            I can do Juneau tues evening -thurs next wk instead of tonight . Ppt is way too impt to be absent from the discussions . Thomas
            and Wilson should be told of the ppt importance this week, can they either fly up here if their mtg tomorrow can't wait, or be
            patient with my schedule until i can get there tues-thurs next week.

            Doesnt it make sense for me to also conduct the interviees via phone , as I've done every other judge interview ? And I'm still
            not comfortable with the pptlgross presentation from yest . We still haven 't spoken to Mark.

           this week's schedule again got pretty full with mtgs that could wait , in light of the gravity of the ppt discussions that are so
           important to tackle before tues . Remember im booked over the weekend so yest , today and tomorrow are very imp days for
           my participation in ppt debate . We have to strategize better on the scheduling when we know something huge is around the
           corner so our days are more flexible leading up to a big roll-out again.

           We were working on a plan tonight to get to legislators about PPT by dividing our folks into teams . If we do walk through
           the economics we can show that we have studied many options and have the best balance of revenue and positive investment
           climate. We all concluded that thursday and friday are critical to reach legislators and that it would be very helpful if I could
           take several of the meetings (namely Lyda and Charlie). What would you think if I stayed in anchorage thurs and did not go
           to Juneau and participate in the judicial interviews?
           We have done a pretty good tag team approach so far and I do not to leave you short staffed.
