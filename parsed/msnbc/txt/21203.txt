         I'll let Linda know. I believe Bob is talking with the troopers in NY on new flight
         arrangements /solutions. Please let me know if I can do anything.

         They may need a new purchase of tickets be these fits are all messed up with weather. And
         i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pls let
         linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
         fairbanks.

          Your connection will be 30 minutes - enough time to make flight. If you change, not arrive
          til 2 am
