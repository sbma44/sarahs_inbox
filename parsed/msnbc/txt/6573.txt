         Ok. But next week will be a bear trying to get to Juneau ( instead of today and tomorrow)
         with Todd on the slope . I'm not sure who's scheduling next wk ' s Juneau appts , but the
         ideal is for Juneau mtgs to take place when todd is home - so he can take the kids. Don't
         want to be picky about it, but the schedule should ideally reflect my work in Anchorage
         when todd ' s on slope , Juneau when he's in wasilla . Almost a week-on , week - off sched until
         next semester starts when the girls can be with me in Juneau.



         Confidential be people gossip too much about my sched already . Thanks!

        I'll get the kids in school today , then, unless Tibbles is already in Anchorage for our
        ppt mtgs tomorrow , I need to get to Juneau tonight and spend the day there tomorrow.
        (Otherwise I won ' t get there again until next week.)
