              I assume that with the prices paid for tickets these days, that if we HAD to stay an extra day we
              could change?

              Governor - we need to confirm up and purchase flights for MN as flights are filling up fast with the thousands
              attending event Your first speech is Sept 2 (evening). Your second speech will be either Sept 2 or Sept 3
              (they are leaning more towards Sept. 3). The flights listed would put you in MN the day before the first speech on
              Monday, Sept 1. The return would be on Thursday, Sept. 4 the day after your second speech . RNC is covering
              the airfare cost for you.
