You're right. He and I discussed regional balance too. He asked specifically how mat-su faired and I
told him that you made sure mat-su got no more than anyone else. I explained the budget process-
how we looked at all of the 1,000 or so add ons by category and then looked again by district. I told
him I'd call him again from whitehorse tonight to follow up.

Thanks Ivy. All those projects were moved to be "considered ' in 09 budget , and 92 . 5 percent of those
"moved " projects ended up being funded . They've got nothing to complain about there - there was no
agreement or promise to veto -proof the items . Sean also didn't grasp the regional balance we tried to
strike for lawmakers since they didn 't do it. Steve should talk to friendlies instead of just meyer, sted,
etc.



The adn editorial wasn't bad anyway!

I just gave steve a call re: cockerham's budget story. He said Ann wrote one too and would check in
w her to see where it ran. He said there could likely be a follow-up budget story on tues and he'd
follow up w us before he filed. He was intrigued by the operating cuts and he or ann will follow up w
Karen.

 Hey Steve,

 When is AP following up on the AND budget story? Cockerham, I think, failed to grasp the hard work
that went into making cuts, being fair, distributing appropriations proportionally, etc. No project was
ever veto proof. The governor and her team made this very clear months ago and has continued to
say it throughout the budget process. Meyer's comments about a "gentlemen's agreement" are
rediculous. The governor said she would add some of last year's vetoed projects into this year's
capital budget to consider them again, not to fund all of them. A large majority of them were funded
this year despite his comments. Also, Stedman, shouldn't be complaining about projects he didn't
receive, instead he should focus on the point that his senate district alone received more capital
funding and projects than any of the others in the state. His focussing on the few projects that were
cut in his is as he calls it "pure politics". Also, Cockerham didn't seem to understand the significance
of reducing the operating budget. Governor's rarely reduce the operating; the last time was under
Hickel I believe, some 20 yrs ago. The governor is comitted to reducing the growth of government,
cutting uneeded operations, while also holding harmless education funding that she worked tirelessly
for last session, and also labor contract increases that were agreed upon between the state and
various unions. Her reduction on the operating side goes straight to the cbr. The governor crafted two
thoughtful and fair budgets that Alaskans will appreciate. Thanks for your time Steve. I appreciate
you listening. Please let me know if you or Ann needs to touch base with the governor's office today.
I'm in and out of cell coverage, but leave a voicemail or send an email and I'll get back to you asap.

Thanks!

Ivy
