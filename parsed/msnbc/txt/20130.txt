               TRANSFORMING HIGHER EDUCATION

              On July 18, Secretary Spellings delivered remarks at the 2008 Higher Education Summit in Chicago.
              "While I still have the bully pulpit, I want to speak frankly to you about what I think needs to be
              done," she said. "The National Center for Higher Education Management Systems estimates, to
              keep up with international competition, at least 20 million more Americans must access higher
              education by 2025.... To meet this challenge, we must improve the 'Three A's' of access,
              affordability, and accountability." "We, at the federal level, are doing more," she continued. In
              2008, Pell grantees will benefit from the largest increase in their annual award in 30 years, and all
              students will benefit from new tools to help them choose a college and apply for financial aid,
              including College.gov, the FAFSA4caster, the College Navigator, and a "Federal Aid First"
              brochure. "In addition," she noted, "I'm heartened that a pioneering band of innovators is
              embracing my commission's recommendations," such as the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology's free, open courseware and Stanford University's podcasts of hundreds of free courses.
              "At the same time, I am disappointed that many challenges of leadership remain unmet .... So, I feel
              honor-bound to remind you that, in the absence of continued leadership in education, others will
              step in. When public demand reaches critical mass, policymakers are compelled to act, whether
              they're in Congress or state legislatures." The Secretary concluded with a challenge. "To meet our
              need for 20 million by 2025, we must broaden and elevate the conversation," she said. "Let's start
              by giving ourselves a deadline to reach the halfway point by the next presidential election in 2012.
              We have only begun to tap the potential of the American population." FOR MORE

              STEM PARTNERSHIPS

              On July 22, professional golf player Phil Mickelson and his wife Amy visited the Department to emphasize
              the importance of math and science by showing local students how these subjects influence the game of
              golf. On a mini-golf course temporarily assembled on the floor of the Department's auditorium, the golfer
              known as "Lefty" adeptly demonstrated how angles, friction, and motion all contribute to the direction a
              golf ball rolls. The Mickelsons help sponsor the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teacher Academy, which gives
              teachers practical, hands-on ways of making math and science interesting in the classroom. The academy's
              annual summer camps have prepared 1,200 teachers. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO
              http: / /www.ed.gov/news / pressreleases /2008 /07 /07222008.htmL

              Later that same day, the Mickelsons testified before the House Education and Labor Committee on how
              business-education partnerships can help drive innovation and strengthen math and science education. The
              stellar panel of witnesses also included astronaut Sally Ride, Tom Luce of the National Math and Science
              Initiative, and top representatives from IBM , Raytheon, and Texas Instruments . FOR MORE

              ADA ANNIVERSARY/WOUNDED WARRIORS

              In a recent "Dear Colleague" letter, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Stephanie Monroe commemorates
              the 18th anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with DirabilitiesAct (ADA). "America is undeniably
              stronger because of the ADA and contributions individuals with disabilities have made to every aspect of
              our society," she stated. "The Department's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has played an important role in
             implementing and enforcing the ADA, by working with state and local education agencies, as well as
             postsecondary schools, to make groundbreaking strides in providing access to opportunities for students
             with disabilities on a non-discriminatory basis." Nevertheless, she added, "Today, we face new challenges
             and must implement creative solutions to meet those new challenges. In that vein, I am pleased to
             announce a... Wounded Warriors Initiative." Many veterans returning from Operation Enduring Freedom
              or Operation Iraqi Freedom are individuals with disabilities who intend to pursue higher education (aided by
             the revamped GI Bill). Yet, because these "wounded warriors" acquired disabilities during their service, they
             have no history of receiving disability-based accommodations in high school Accordingly, they are less
             familiar with their disability-related rights and responsibilities. Moreover, most colleges and universities
             have limited experience accommodating students with the types of disabilities associated with these
             individuals. Under the initiative, OCR will support veterans with disabilities who have questions about their
             ADA rights and responsibilities, work with institutions and service providers wanting to know how best to
             support veterans with disabilities, and encourage institutions to adopt innovative approaches to serve this
             important population. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

                    Foreign Language Assistance Program: $2.2 million to increase the number of students learning
                      foreign languages critical to national security or commerce in seven districts and one charter school

                    Special Education: a $1.5 million grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago for a national center
                      that will help minority institutions locate funding for projects that serve students with disabilities,

               ANALYSIS: CTE AND ADULT LITERACY

               "Career and Technical Education (CIE) in the United States: 1990-2005," the latest compendium on CTE
               from the Department's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), looks at CTE offerings, who
               participates in CTE, what types of CTE students take, who teaches CTE, and the labor market and further
               education outcomes attained by CTE participants. The report documents that, between 1990 and 2005, the
               number of CTE credits earned by public high school graduates remained steady, despite the trend of more
               academic coursetaking in high school. The report also found that, at both the high school and college level,
               student participation increased in the occupational areas of health care and computer science, while it
               decreased in business. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

              adults who need to better their basic literacy skills. The report makes six specific recommendations to help
              ensure: (1) federal programs serving adults will be utilized in a manner that increases the effectiveness,
              efficiency, and availability of such programs and (2) literacy skills of adults will be strengthened, thereby

              VOLUNTEERING IN AMERICA

              This week, USA Freedom Corps and the Corporation for National and Community Service launched a new
              web site, http://www.volunte '         america.gov. with volunteering trends throughout the U.S. Users can
              access volunteering data and information for the entire nation, regions, states, and 162 large and mid-sized
              cities. Users will also be able to view how states and cities rank by volunteer rates and hours. Nearly 61
              million Americans volunteered in their communities, giving 8.1 billion hours of service worth more than
              $158 billion. For the third straight year, Utah was the top state with a volunteer rate of 43.9%.
              Minneapolis-St Paul ranked first among large cities, with 39.3%, and Provo, Utah, ranked first among mid-
              sized cities, with a remarkable 68.3%.

              Note: Volunteers spend approximately 15 hours watching TV in a typical week, compared to 23 hours for
              non volunteers. That eight hour difference that adds up to over 400 hours over the course of a year.



              QUOTE TO NOTE

              "One of the biggest barriers to change [in postsecondary education] is a lack of coordination between high
              schools and higher education. Too often, high school coursework is not rigorous or varied enough to act as
              a springboard to success in college.... The problem is not a lack of resources. My agency recently returned
              more than $500 million in Academic Competitiveness (AC)/National Science and Mathematics Access to
              Retain Talent (SMART) grants to the U.S. Treasury. Why? Because we could not find enough college-ready
              students from low-income families to take them. That is $500 million that has gone unused, and countless
              more untapped human potential."

              -- Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings (7/18/08), at the 2008 Higher Education Summit in Chicago

             Subject: President's trip

             If the opportunity arises, I would suggest mentioning progress on the = gas pipeline to the
             President, although my guess is that this subject has = already occurred to you. You might also
             want to indicate your = support for the request made by 10 US Senators that the President =
             authorize seismic work in ANWR (see attached letter).

             My guess is that this request will be opposed by the national = environmental community on the
             grounds that seismic work is exploration, = and exploration is prohibited in ANWR without
             Congressional authorization.&= nbsp; But, a good argument can be made to the contrary based
             on = seismic work done previously.

             In my opinion, mention of these two subjects would have both = substantive and political value,
             as you will undoubted be asked by the = media what you mentioned to the President.

             On another subject, Governor Schweitzer of Montana has also approved = the theme for the
             NGA Natural Resources Committee - Energy Infrastructure.&= nbsp; So, we will proceed with
             NGA and his staff on that basis in light of= your approval last week.

             I hope you enjoy your interaction with the President.
