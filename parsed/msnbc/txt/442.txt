  Not on a Fast Track
  The legislature is about thirty days from the end of their last 120-day session. To show their respect
  for the 90-day initiative requirement, many legislators had hoped to finish their work in 90 days or
  less this year. In fact, outside the Speaker's chambers a running count was kept totaling days passed
  out of 90. It is safe to say, that the number 90 is no longer visible nor are any legislators talking
  about leaving early.

  In keeping with custom, 30 days out, much work remains for the legislature as a whole. The
  operating budget just passed the Senate, a conference committee will be next. The capital budget is
  just starting to be assembled in the Senate, but still needs House approval as well. Ethics reform,
  another legislative priority, is still being worked-on and needs Senate approval. AGIA, the Governor's
  gasline inducement act, is still in Senate Judiciary and House Resources Committee respectively
  getting a thorough review day after day. Both versions still need to go to each body's Finance
  Committee before any floor action.

  Operating Budget
  The OP budget passed the House about two weeks ago and was just recently passed by the Senate.
   The House passed an $8.987 billion budget. Believe it or not, this is actually down from the
  Governor's amended budget of $10.4 billion according to Legislative Finance Division. The Senate's
  version is down from the House by $70 million at $8.924 billion. Both budget totals include all funds.
   A conference committee will be appointed shortly consisting of members from both bodies to work
  out the differences between each budget.

  Capital Budget
  The capital budget is in its beginning stages and legislative members are still collecting back-up
  information on priority lists for their respective communities. The Senate Finance Committee normally
  leads the charge on the Capital Budget passing their version of the bill first. The Senate is hearing
  from each State Dept on their capital needs and is expected pass their version in the next week or so.
   Governor Palin has issued a declaration concerning the capital budget that any project submitted by
  members of the legislature for funding must have matching funds from outside sources. This should
  keep the capital budget down from previous years, as state funds must have federal or private
  matching funds for legislator's projects.

  Ethics Reform
  An amalgamation bill encompassing many different bills on ethics passed the House about two weeks ago.
   The bill, HB 109 is awaiting committee work in the Senate State Affairs committee . Two Senate bills on
  legislative ethics currently sit in the House Judiciary committee . All three bills have many of the same
  attributes , yet HB 109 appears to be the lead vehicle on Ethics ; however, neither the Senate nor the House
  has scheduled a hearing for either body ' s bills. Is this a legislative standoff? Too early to tell, but legislative
  ethics was the hot topic for the legislature to address after federal indictments and federal subpoenas were
  issued last year. The hot t! opic has cooled considerably . Likely, a public initiative will arise if the legislature
  fails to make substantive changes this year.

  AGIA - AK Gasline Inducement Act
  One could safely assume that most state residents are aware of the little acronym now famously called AGIA.
   The bills SB 104 and HB 177 have been heard in each body roughly 25 times each so far. Of course, the bills
  are up for a hearing again today, and of course, tomorrow. The bills were both assigned three committee
  referrals and are only in the second committee of referral in each body. Producers, explorers, leaseholders,
  pipeline builders, gas consultants, permitting consultants, federal regulators, resident experts, economists and
  state gasline experts have all provided countless hours of testimony, jargon, acronyms, mathematical
  computations and reams and reams of paper. The project is expected to co! st anywhere between $25 and 35
  billion, which would be the largest oil or gas project in the world. According to testimony from BP and Exxon,
  the amount of gas projected to be shipped would account for more than 10% of each company's total gas
  production. Obviously, the size of the project and legal ramifications make the proposed project immense.

  Currently, the decline in oil production is expected to occur in the next 10 years creating a huge budget
  shortfall for the state and an unused oil pipeline. While this is a very important project for the state, it seems
  the timeframe for accessing the gas markets may be closing. Multiple projects have entered permitting phase
  across the nation with gas expected to be coming to the U.S. from all over the world. The concern for many
  is that if the state fails to act quickly, the gasline project may be unwarranted altogether as new supplies of
  natural gas fill a growing U.S. market. Testimony has suggested that AGIA may be too prescriptive for
  companies to realistically commit to a gasline project. Proponents of AGIA believe that the bills ultima! tely
  force the producers and pipeline builders to the table to build the line. One thing we do know for sure is that
  time is running out.


  Public Retirement will Likely Affect Business
  The outstanding liability for PERS/TRS employees has topped well over 10 billion. However, new funding by
  the state each year will supplement teachers and state employee rates. Remaining are local public employees
  that are part of the PERS system. This is particularly important to business interests as businesses pay
  property taxes, which ultimately pays for local municipal employees. Many local municipalities have huge
  outstanding debts for their retired public employees. If each municipality were forced to make the retirement
  systems whole this year, local property taxes would go through the roof.

  The Ways and Means Committee recently passed out HB 206 consolidating all PERS employers to one common
  rate with the state picking up 65% of the unfunded liability. The committee forwarded a letter of intent with
  the bill to the Finance committee that encourages the adoption of a cost share plan more equitable to
  employers whose rates may not be as high as the consolidated rate (predicted to by 31.86% under the
  governor's cost share proposal). The rate is set at 22% for each municipality. One issue of concern is that
  many local municipalities may have less debt for retired employees that would be considerably less that the
  22% contribution rate. The finance committee is expected to deal with a hold-harmless provision to address
  this issue. The bill will be matched up with the Govern! or's PERS TRS bill, SB 125, which will likely become
  the vehicle for final passage.


  Washington State Container Tax
  Washington State Senator Haugen's bill to tax all cargo containers to and from Alaska turned into a study on
  congestion relief. The bill originally proposed adding a $50 fee on each 20ft container shipped to and
  returning to Washington State. Alaska receives nearly 97 percent by weight and 60 percent of the value of all
  its goods shipped via water from Washington State and would have paid a heavy toll. The cost alone on one
  40ft container would have been $300 to and from Washington State.

  In January, the State Chamber alerted the Governor's office and members of the legislature. The State
  Chamber adopted a resolution at its February Board meeting, the State Legislature passed similar legislation


                                                                                                   ROSTON 00180

Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
  while members of the State Chamber and officials from the Governor's office lobbied key member of the
  Washington State Legislature encouraging a change in direction with regards to taxing Alaskan residents. This
  issue may arise again in the future as Washington State and California look towards cargo containers for
  future tax revenues. A special thanks goes out to Shari Gross, of Gross and Associates, Rich Berl kowitz of
  the Transportation Institute, Scott Pattison, from the Port of Seattle, Caroline Higgins and Renata Benett of
  TOTE and many others for all of their efforts in educating and lobbying on this issue.

  State Chamber Continues to Look After Business
  The State Chamber has been busy recently working on Unemployment Insurance, worker's compensation,
  water discharge primacy, tourism issues with regards to the initiative, Polar Bear ESA listing, Tongass
  Management Plan, and many other issues as well. Below is list of the bills the Chamber is currently working
  on or keeping a close eye on. As always, if there is an issue that is important to you and your business or you
  would like to see where we are at on a particular issue, please don't hesitate to contact our office via email or
  phone.

  Below is our unofficial list of bills. Click on the bill number and if you are connected to the internet the state's
