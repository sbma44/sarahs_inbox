                Rep. John Harris is reaching too far
                Rep. John Harris, R-Valdez, needs to do the right thing and hand the gavel over to an objective
                member of the House Finance Committee. He said just a few months ago he would ask finance Co-
               Chairman Mike Chenault to hand over the gavel to Vice Chairman Bill Stoltze to run committee
                hearings should the committee be considering oil tax legislation. Chenault owns a construction
                business that has done regular oil field service work in the past. Harris has flip-flopped on allowing
               an objective Finance member chair the committee dealing with Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share
               oil tax plan.
               Instead of telling Alaskans why he has flip-flopped on this Important issue, Harris compares
               Chenault's chairmanship to Todd Palln working on the slope. There's no comparison! Chenault Is a
               lawmaker considering and evaluating oil and gas tax legislation that will effect our entire state.
               Todd is a laborer removed from any decision making. Harris needs to own up to his error In
               judgment, and not blame the Palin family for his mistakes.
