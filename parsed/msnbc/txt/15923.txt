                 Subject: PSEA ratified Friday

               I forgot to mention - ballots were counted on Friday June 6 - and PSEA ratified our
               offer. This contract is difficult to briefly explain because it contains so many
               premium pays, but essentially the offer was:

               5% increase July 1, 2008
               Service steps beginning July 1, 2008
               One-time only step increase for Bachelor's degree
               Field Training Officers receive 7.5% increase up from 5% increase over salary for
               stepping up and being a training officer. Hopefully, this will mean that only the best
               will be selected to be training officers.
               For obtaining an Intermediate or Advanced Police Certificate issued by the Police
               Standards Council - 3.75%

               3% increase July 1, 2009

               3% increase July 1, 2010

               We faced competition. from other police departments (most notably MOA), but were
               able to structure a competitive offer that I believe will help with recruitment and
               retention of employees who the State has invested much to train.

               IBU - one of the maritime unions has ballots out and well see if they turn down the
               offer we made to them. Deadline is June 27. It could go either way, as the Masters,
               Mates and Pilots and Marine Engineers Beneficial Association are dragging their
               collective feet on agreements.

               Once maritime contracts are settled , we can focus on other things (EEO Plan,
               grievances, Labor Department Building, Recruitment and Retention ) until September
               when we begin negotiations with the Correctional Officers (ACOA).
