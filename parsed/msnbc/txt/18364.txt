              Governor/ Sharon, if you need more information, please let me know.

              Also, if the Administration feels the need at any point, I could put a letter together to
              the White House, our Senators, or the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
              Committee. However, in honesty, I don't think that this would accomplish much
              given what is already occurring.

                Sharon- sounds like this is the issue that the reporter from Monocal Magazine
                was asking about yesterday. I didn't know the context of the issue he was raising
                about "...our concern (or lack of) about the arctic territorial issues...". Maybe he'd
                spoken to critics at VOT before our interview?

                In today's column entitled, "Alaska has a role to play in staking a North Pole
                Claim," the voice of the times states:
                As far as we know, neither the governor nor anyone else in her administration

                 even took note of what was going on - first with Canada jumping into the fray,
                 and staking its claim to the same territory the Russians deem to be theirs, and
                 shortly thereafter with Denmark getting into the act.
                 With this in mind, I just wanted you to know that the Governor's DC office follows
                 the territorial issue very closely. The predicate for the assertion by the US of
                 territorial claims in the Arctic is Senate ratification of the Convention on the Law
                 of the Sea, together with appropriate research. The Convention establishes the
                 framework for the assertion of claims by individual countries before the United
                 Nations.

                 In the past, the State has supported Senate ratification of the Treaty. So does a
                 majority of the Senate. However, ratification has been blocked by a few Senators
                 who are concerned that the Convention will lead to the loss of US sovereignty.
                 Quite the opposite is true.

                 The word is that the Senate, with strong support from the Bush administration,
                 will consider the Convention in the fall. Both of Alaska's Senators have
                 previously supported the Convention. In addition, the Bush administration has
                 taken steps to acquire the information necessary to assert a territorial claim.

                 A quick call from someone at the Voice of the Times would have elicited the
                 response that the Palin administration is very much aware of the current
                 situation. Given the parliamentary situation in the Senate and the position of the
                 Bush administration and Alaska's Senators, there is little more for us to do at
                 this time.
