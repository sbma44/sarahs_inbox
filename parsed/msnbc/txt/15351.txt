          We need to get the word out on our intent tq sue before we release AGIA findings this
         week. Our pro-development folks who'll criticize AGIA will at least then have something to
         unite with us on... so let's get that presser out tomorrow.



          Alaskans in general will be anxious to hear what the plan is to protect this state.
