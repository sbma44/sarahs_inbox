                 Subject: Re: Location of new Crime Lab
                Governor,

                After reviewing the options on where to build the new Crime Lab, Anchorage was chosen over Kenai and
                The Mat-Su Valley for the following reasons:

                     APD is by far the largest user at 72% and even if such usage rate continued , a move to Kenai
                      would drive up their expense in shipping evidence and slow their responsiveness to the citizens
                      they serve.

                     The staff currently working at the Crime Lab would have to uproot themselves and their families
                      and that may cause some to re-think employment with DPS; a consideration as the crime Lab is
                      currently understaffed.

                     Many Troopers transport their prisoners into Anchorage and hand carry evidence to the Crime Lab
                      now, to move the Lab out of Anchorage would further tie up that traveling Trooper to other
                      communities, like Palmer or Kenai, before he or she can return to their assigned post.

                     Finally, the cost for the land in Anchorage is the same price as it would be in Kenai, no cost. (As
                       per conversation with MOA Heritage Land Bank Manager with Deputy Commissioner Glass.)

                Any questions, please contact me anytime.
                -Walt
