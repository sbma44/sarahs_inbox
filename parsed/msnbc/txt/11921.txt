               Rachel and Grace used to get off the school bus and walk up to my office in the Senate Finance room . These are
               family adjustments that have to be made to survive and to suggest there is anything inappropriate is wrong. Also,
               they bring a dose of reality to this fishbowl . Most of Alaska would be glad to hear that you care enough about the
               girls that you are with them part of the day . SHEESH ... Children add value -they don't detract.
