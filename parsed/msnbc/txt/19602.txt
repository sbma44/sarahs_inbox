            Would you check w Comm dept today to see if they do this presser? Rosanne would probably
            enjoy such a thing be it's military-related:

             You know, that's something Kopp could come right out of the shoot with, even in a presser:
             filling the long-vacant positions w efforts to recruit our returning military personnel.
             Lots of these soldiers don't know what to do next as their deployments conclude... we may
             need them. Pls mention this to him, that we need very vocal and visual DPS initiatives
             rolled out for Alaskans so they'll know the purpose in all this transition is for action
             in serving the public.

             Rolling out such a promise, Sharon and Rosanne could help because we got a good supportive
             statement from Col. Holloway re: Kopp and "moving forward"... we could incorporate that
             statement with any from Gen. Campbell also. (So not just Natl Guard, but military in
             general.)

            Thanks Governor .  It's an interesting approach that I like. Plus, we don't even need the
            whole 19 million acre reserve , just 2,000 acres where the oil is and enough to get it out
            of the reserve .  Amazing that democrats in Congress will call for steps like not adding
            small amounts of oil to the strategic reserve and tout that as helpful to the energy
            crisis but then complain the million barrels a day in oil and trillions of cubic feet of
            natural gas in ANWR isn't enough to help the nation.



           I'll be in Anchorage today and tomorrow meeting with Chuck Kopp to discuss steps we can
           take on crime in rural Alaska and improving recruiting etc. There are several things Walt
           didn't really seem to work hard on or want to do, like recruiting from returning National
           Guard and military, or finding ways to improve our local option laws and cracking down on
           bootlegging that could be helpful. I will pass these ideas on to Chuck and mention the
           recruiting ideas to Joe Schmidt for DOC to consider.

             Fyi- congressman hall from texas is introducing a bill that would transfer ownership of
             ANWR from the feds to the state. I'm on record supporting the idea and his bill. It may be
             an interesting subject for alaskans to hear about. I've promised expedited development if
             the transfer were ever to take place.
