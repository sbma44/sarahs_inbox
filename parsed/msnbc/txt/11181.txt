              Hopefully last word on this - Sharon, we did not change the time of SoS to 4pm. We gave
              up, gave in - this was Lyda's change, again. It's being reported that I changed the time
              from 6pm to 4pm.

               Sharon: "This is nonsense. This was NEVER about acommodating "personal travel
               arrangements ". Travel arrangements to my son's military graduation into the Infantry were
               made subsequent to Lyda's permission, given a month ago, to address Alaskans in the State
               of the State on the first day of the shortened session .  She knows this. And this is an
               unfortunate indication that some would rather spend time and resources on things other
               than working together and progressing this state."

              Sharon/Beth- lyda is saying this is so "the Governor can accommodate her personal travel
              schedule". Be strong and solid in response back on that- it's bull, she's again spinning
              this, and she must be called on this. Please

              Sheeeesh- lyda just changed it again to 4pm, even tho this may not be a "legal" sos
              because she says they won't convene until 6pm (AFTER the sos address) and you're supposed
              to present sos after they gavel in/convene.
