          Our congratulations and best wishes on the dear little man who has just joined the Palin
          family.  We applaud your decision to get on a plane and come home to have the baby in
          Alaska. Certainly God had purpose in sending Tryg to you and Todd and we know that he will
          bring much joy to your family as you love him and help him grow to his greatest potential.
          We think you are doing an exemplary job as Governor and support and appreciate you. Your
