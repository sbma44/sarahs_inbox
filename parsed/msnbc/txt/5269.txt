                  Subject: March 1 Appointments

                Governor Pal!n,

                I'm attaching the last 4 boards with March 1 term expiration dates. These boards do not require legislative
                confirmation . I'm sending this today incase you want to print a hard copy for the plane or so you can read via
                your Pocket PC . I know you have other reading and sleep to catch up on, but just in case you feel up to reading
                my preliminary recommendations they are here for your consideration.

                I was purposely vague on some of the candidates because I think a conversation would be more appropriate. I
                have background information on all applicants and current board members . This email is to give you a sense of
                the boards and the members.

                Thank you for all of your time with boards and commission ! You've made my job enjoyable with your accessibility
                and all of your input. I've supplied Mike with a hard copy and will go over these boards with him today.
