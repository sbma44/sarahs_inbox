                  I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State . I wanted to get you something for the
                  2008 speech before the end of 2007. Anyway, let me know if you think it is on the right track.

                  I thought I would take a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow. On Wednesday, I thought I
                  would have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry Persily help me fact check and test
                  sensitivity and direction . There are some items in the draft that have not been made public yet. Two
                  examples are Habitat and Health Care reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out

                  Last year\u700 ?s speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long. I tried to keep it shorter this time.
                  This draft is now 3800 words , hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was shooting for.

                  Happy New Year!

                  Mike
