            Rosanne: can you do this - Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:

            No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with
            the video Andy and Jason took great effort to make, where I'm saying "rah rah" in support
            of the participants... and my husband took TWO DAYS of his slammed schedule to judge the
            pageant even!!! He left commercial fishing early to keep his committment to judge the
            thing!!!   (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so
            no, I didn't make it in person, I was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to
            fairbanks to meet with seven members of the US Congress on ANWR, but... Sheeeesh- can
            folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of support" on something. Argggggh!

               You know, I think I'll do my own letter of correction on this one.
