              In the meantime I'm saying fish is first, and not listing what's second or third. Thanks

             I'm sorry, but this has been a hair pulling experience. This information is not as easy to
             find as I thought (or as it should be). Spoke with Emil and he'll see what he can find
             out. I left msg w/Joe.   Frank spoke to folks in labor: Click & Paula and wasn't able to
             get definitive info, Paula said that it is difficult to say as it can be interpreted
             differently based on source (?).



             However , according to ASMI' s website , fishing /seafood is largest . According to ATIA's
             site , tourism is third (however I've also seen where it is referenced as 2nd ).    I've been
             trying to find out what would then be third, oil & gas?



             Hopefully Sean has a better idea on resources but I'll keep trying.

             Thank you. Maybe Emil or Joey knows off top of head? I'm sure it's correct but want
             verification

             That fisheries are our largest private-sector employer in the state? (Tourism is second?)
