             Hopefully last word on this - Sharon, we did not change the time of SoS

             to 4pm. We gave up, gave in - this was Lyda's change, again. It's being

             reported that I changed the time from 6pm to 4pm.

              Sharon: "This is nonsense. This was NEVER about acommodating "personal

              travel arrangements". Travel arrangements to my son's military

              graduation into the Infantry were made subsequent to Lyda's permission,

              given a month ago, to address Alaskans in the State of the State on the

              first day of the shortened session. She knows this. And this is an

              unfortunate indication that some would rather spend time and resources

              on things other than working together and progressing this state."

              Sharon/ Beth - lyda is saying this is so "the Governor    can accommodate her

              personal travel schedule". Be strong and solid in response back on that-

              it's bull, she' s again spinning this, and she must be called on this.

             Sheeeesh - lyda just changed it again to 4pm, even tho this may not be a

              "legal" sos because she says they won't convene until 6pm (AFTER the sos

             address ) and you're supposed to present sos after they gavel in/convene.
