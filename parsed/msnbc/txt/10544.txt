             Governor - just spoke to them. Go out Old Glen - Go 7-8 miles and you will come to Yellow
             Blinking Lt. turn Right - continue approx. 3-4 miles and you will come to Spur Rd. - small
             sign probably covered in snow - there is a gate there. Let me know and I can call you to
             walk you through also. Janice
