             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                        No. 08-011




             Governor Stands by AGIA Process




             January 26, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today responded to claims made by
             ConocoPhillips regarding the State's rejection of the company's natural gas pipeline
             proposal, which was submitted outside the AGIA process.




            "AGIA sets forth a vehicle that delivers North Slope gas to market with certification and
            construction benchmarks, expansion provisions, tariff terms, and other protections the
            state, and the nation, need. It is unfortunate that ConocoPhillips elected not to
            participate in this sensible competitive process as did other fine companies."

                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0010671

             The Governor also clarified that the state has never refused to work with ConocoPhillips
             on a mutually beneficial plan to get the producers ' gas into a pipeline' to market.




             Governor Palin on Wednesday spoke with ConocoPhillips president Jim Bowles about this
             issue.




             "While the ConocoPhillips ' alternative obviously falls outside of AGIA ' s terms, we have
             long sought a way for ConocoPhillips to work with the state and the AGIA licensee toward a
             mutual goal of getting ConocoPhillips' gas into a line to market .  We have had several
             discussions along these lines , and will continue to do so. Statements to the contrary are
             simply untrue , and only serve to confuse Alaskans."
