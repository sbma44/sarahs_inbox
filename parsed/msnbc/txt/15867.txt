           Why the heck would they choose to GROW an already bloated budget, esp going into
           reelections?

           From Wesley Loy in Juneau -

           Hearings on the natural gas pipeline were suspended for a time this morning as leading
           legislators prowled the Capitol for enough votes to override Gov. Sarah Palin's recent
           budget vetoes.

           Right now, it looks like the leadership isn't confident it has the votes. To override
           Palin, 45 of the 60 senators and representatives meeting in a joint session would have to
           vote in favor.

           Palin last month used her veto pen to ax about $ 268 million from state budgets lawmakers
           had passed in April for next year.

           Some top Republican lawmakers including Senate President Lyda Green of Wasilla are
           frustrated with the popular Republican governor ' s second straight year of cuts and today
           are trying to mount the difficult veto override.

           The lawmakers , meeting in special session on the natural gas pipeline , don't have much
           time.

           Under the rules , they have through tomorrow to carry off a veto override . But many
           lawmakers are expected to go home this weekend, so from a practical standpoint it probably
           has to happen today if at all.

           Lawmakers are circulating lists through the Capitol showing a total of about $81 million
           in vetoed projects - dozens of items - they ' re aiming to restore.

           Many involve health,     safety and school needs.

          Among Anchorage and Mat-Su items on the lists:

           * Computer equipment for Rabbit Creek and Oceanview elementary schools ,              $ 15,000 each
           Totem East Anchorage ball fields , $ 120,000

           * Wasilla recycling center , $ 1 million

           * Expansion of Covenant House in Anchorage , $ 1.1 million

           * Anchorage Fire Department Station 6 replacement in Muldoon , $ 6 million

           * Anchorage Police Department headquarters expansion ,          $ 17.5 million

          Republican lawmakers including Rep. Kevin Meyer, R -Anchorage , say Palin had signaled she
          wouldn ' t veto some of the items she did.

                                                               2




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0018960

           They believe the state, flush with billions of dollars in surplus oil money, can well
           afford to spend more for projects they say local communities and organizations consider
           priorities.

           Palin, however, has said some of the spending isn't the state's responsibility, and she
           wants to slow the growth of state budgets for the years when Alaska might not be so rich.

           If lawmakers can override her vetoes, it would mark a significant political victory for
           them against a governor whose popularity has seemed to overpower the legislative branch.

           Should be fascinating to see how it plays out!
