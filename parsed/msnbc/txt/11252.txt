                Dear Honorable Governor Palin,

                I hope you had an opportunity to look over the Native Issues calendared dates and
                consider our invitation to be one of our featured speakers this legislative season.
                Here is that invite:

                On behalf of Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska Office
                of the President we hereby request your presence and participation as one of our
                featured speakers for 2008 Native Issues Forum this legislative season. The forum
                is scheduled at the ANB Hall located at 320 West Willoughby Avenue here in
                Juneau. The Native Issues Forum begins approximately at 11:45 AM with a
                homemade delicious lunch and we would love to offer you a courtesy lunch. This
                is a popular forum that brings together 125-250 people at a time.

                If you can speak your topic can concentrate on the different issues that you are
                addressing this legislative session , promoting any cause that you would like
                community participation in and/or your work and involvement with Native entities.
                There will be a question period available for guests present immediately following
                and the forum will conclude approximately at 1:00 PM.

                We are proud of our continuing partnership with our Alaska Native Brotherhood
                Camp 2 in being able to provide this popular open forum to the public. The
                continued support from our legislators and local community organizations that
                make the time to be part of this is very important and meaningful; with State and
                Government involvement we can look forward to another successful year!

                Here is the calendar for Native Issues Forum this year (see Open for available
                dates):
