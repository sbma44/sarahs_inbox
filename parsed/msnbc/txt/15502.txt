            Wanted to do bridge naming bill w Rhonda in Nenana . Others on this list have been
            discussed for venues that would allow me to travel and do some creative things like the
            well baby exams . I realluy need to get to Peninsula and Frbnks and elsewhere and some of
            these bills provide good reasons to do so. I'll let others strategize on these too as I
            type my speech for tomorrow.

             Subject: Proposed Bill Signing Appts - Wed June 4th




             Governor,



            After tomorrow, we will have 10 bills to sign by next Wednesday, June 4th. With AGIA
            being the main focus, I thought it might be a good idea to schedule one-hour on Wednesday
            morning and possibly a media event at noon in Juneau for bill signing. I have already
            checked with Janice and your schedule is available as long as you are in Juneau.




             DATE:                                 Wednesday, June 4th

             TIME:                                  9am (1 hour)

            WHERE:                             Governor's Office, Juneau (In-house, no media)



             BILLS TO BE SIGNED W/ SPONSORS:

                         SB 57   Elton                  Marine parks additions (Elton has requested a
             signing at the University but time is too tight)

                          SB 119 Olson                       School library grants

                          SB 158 Kookesh                 Shirley Demientieff memorial bridge

                          SB 164 McGuire                   Used motor vehicle sales

                          SB 170 McGuire                   Insurance coverage for well-baby exams

                                                                   1

                           SB 211 Davis                 Aggravating factor : homeless

                         SB 214 Huggins             Hunting by military ; Coast Guard ( unless this is
             signed in a ceremony on Monday, the 2nd)

                           HB 268 Stoltze                Burning motor vehicles on public lands



             BILLS TO BE SIGNED W /O SPONSORS:

                            SB 8      Davis                Mental health patients right to pick gender of
             staff   Privileged or Personal Materi

                         SB 101 Ellis                      Guardianship & Conservators       (already did a
             ceremonial signing for the bill)



            Another alternative would be to pull all/any bills to do with crime and hold one. media-
            related signing ceremony in Juneau - probably the Governor' s Conference Room unless
            Commissioner Monegan has a better idea - relating to crime issues.    This ceremony could be
            sent out as a media advisory etc.   If you'd like to do this, we'd need 30 + minutes on the
            same day, Tuesday, June 4th to sign SB 211 ( above ), HB 268 (above), SB 265 (Criminal
            omnibus bill), and perhaps HB 88 (TVs/monitors in vehicles), HB 193 (Police Standards
            Council), HB 286 (impersonating a public servant), and a few others I'll discuss with DPS.



            If you like this as well , we could do this around the lunch hour so legislators could
            attend and not miss AGIA hearings : Wednesday , June 4th at noon for 30+ minutes.



            Please let me know how you would like to proceed.



            Thanks, Kelly



            PS After this grouping is attended to, the next set of 14 bills will be due by Monday,
            June 9th; although not all require a signing event.
