           May I find a borrowed baby jogger for tomorrow's photo shoot- know anyone who'd have one
           handy?

               When did she ask? We've been here at the house...
               Did you formulate a statement for her yet, based on this email and the other one of mine and
               Randy's?
               Who is responding?

               Governor, I did not say anything without being able to run it by you first. I just talked to her and she said she can
               give us 45 minutes to get her a statement. So it is not too late.

               Subject: Walt


               Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and his claim that it was only
               four.
                I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone call and face-to-face that I
               had with Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                 Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                 Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was
               NEVER refused any request to meet with any of us. He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG,
               also, in "communications " with me.
                Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.
               And pls pass on the Bill McA. What's his email addy?
                Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points. Thanks
