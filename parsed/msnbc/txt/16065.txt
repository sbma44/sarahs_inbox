            So, you had a bill on your desk for a prescription drug database, and you chose to let it
            become law *without* your signature.  You're a coward. God forbid our state's executive
            "leadership" would have to make a decision about the relative merits of any given bill.
            You appear to be a coward in any situation that doesn't have an apparent groundswell of
            support.




            That makes you a poll-driven governor, much like the Clinton Presidency was. Exactly what
            Alaska needed.  It also makes you a liar, since you have done nothing demonstrate that
            you're the conservative or family-centric person you claim to be.
