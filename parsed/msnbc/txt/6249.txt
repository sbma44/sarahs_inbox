        Very much so...on Wes.

         Do you want me to bring up character training? I think we're missing the boat by simply
        focusing on ethics.

          We cant afford it, the Feds won't pay for it, the general populace isn't placing it as a
        high priority ... can you diplomatically express that ?!   Of course we want infrastructure
        - and this is NOT a " bridge to nowhere" ( that is so offensive ), but as it stands today
        with the highest - cost bridge design selected by the Ketchikan community , we need to find a
        lower - cost alternative is a bridge will be built.

          Don't know if you are reading your BB during the cabinet meeting , but if I get a
        question from the audience at noon ( Ketchikan Rotary ) about the Ketchikan bridge . What's
        your current view?
