        We just notified the sponsors of the water-mining initiative that I was denying
        certification of that initiative (Tim McKeever is their lawyer that we notified). We got
        good input from Sharon on the press release and have made changes there, but have not sent
        that out yet. We will send press release and talking points soon, I believe. (We haven't
        notified the press yet.)
