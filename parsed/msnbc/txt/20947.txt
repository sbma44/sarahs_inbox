              Reminds me of junior high, where hormonal teenagers are always looking for the drama and something/anything to
              talk about, but these are adults... needing to fill up lines in the Ear.

              I'll do my best to avoid giving them any potential news nuggets; I'm open to any comments or suggestions.

              Man, that gossip crap bugs me. Any time it has anything to do with home or family , its irritating . Maybe she knows
              that though.

              I'll call Sheila- again!



              She knows there is an easy explanation for this stuff- but she chooses to run with it. She knows that if she calls me
              on these issues - 99 percent of the time they wouldn ' t make it in.

             For the plumbing project the dishwashing and pantry areas will have demolition work to walls and ceilings in order to access
             the old pipes, etc... The House china and stemware needed to be packed up and stored by professional movers , to ensure that
             they'd be safe as the cabinets need to be removed . They should be in storage for about a month , then we'll have the moving
             van again.



             I'm sorry that made the news ; I can have them park in the back and they can carry boxes down a flight of stairs and out the
             back instead of just going out the front door. It's worth it, to avoid giving anyone more ammunition.



             The thought crossed my mind, but I didn't think someone would be so hard pressed to include that in the ear. Did they not
             notice all the cars around the House? The Wolfson contractor van and other workers ' vehicles from the window project, or
             the Simplex Grinell vehicle fixing the security cameras , or Silverbow Const. or Harri's Plumbing trucks parked outside
             working on the plumbing - nope, just the WWM van.



             Major problems in this 95 year old House are being addressed and it's crazy that they 're using the van as something to take a
             jab at you with.
