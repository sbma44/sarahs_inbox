             Thanks, Kelly!     I'll make sure those changes are reflected in the Governor's remarks and
             event info.

            Sen Huggins staff emailed and said he will not be attending due to prior commitment.



            See you all in the morning.

            Governor,



           Here are your remarks and event info for the bill signing (fishing/hunting licenses &
           Guard firefighters) on Monday morning at Ship Creek. I will have a binder prepared for
           you that morning for your convenience. I have not heard whether Senator Huggins has
           confirmed his attendance or not, and so I have worked him into the agenda and your
           remarks, just in case.

                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0018628

              Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or alteration requests with the
