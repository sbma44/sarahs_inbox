               §         The corrosion issue is great politics, but difficult administration. The
               corrosion issue was already fixed in the PPT law by making the first $.30 per BOE capital
               costs non-deductible. This was in lieu of the corrosion costs. This is easy to administer.
               Instead, adjust this figure.



               §         The bill provides for more information sharing between DOR and DNR. This is
               good. However, the joint administration proposed is unnecessary.



               §         I recommend no changes because PPT was a great upheaval. Now, you should focus
               on stability to attract investments. Wait until 2011 before changes are considered.



               §         The economics of business investment are more important than government take and
               responding to corruption.



                           .I applaud the administration's efforts to beef up the auditing.



              §          Although the PPT and aggregation did not put Alaska in the category of a banana
              republic , another significant change would do so -especially for political purposes. It
              was 16 years since the previous major change . Wait until 2011 . You don ' t have any good
              information yet upon which to make a dramatic change that will last for another 15 years.
