        Pretty amazing.  Other than the student member, we have had one vacancy in the Board of
        Education.  You selected Pat Shier, who is a huge supporter of homeschooling. I am sure
        Glen is a big fan of Pat's and if I remember correctly he recommended Pat for the
        position.  The real question is whether the board or the legislature is the appropriate
        entity to make changes. Many board members feel that the legislature should clarify the
        law if additional direction is needed to the board. The issue also gets back to the
        homeschool questionnaire that was prepared during the campaign. I am sure Glen had a hand
        in that, knowing that the general questions asked were really intended to pin you down on
        specific proposals that are now being used against you.




        Thanks for the update and sorry for the heartburn.



        Mike

        Fyi. You got clobbered on Fagan's show as he (and Beigel) claim you led me to break "more
        campaign promises" be of bd of educ members and homeschool issue. But dont worry, i got
        the brunt of it. It was ugly.

         un-flippin-believable.



         the answer is NOTHING .       he was hugely appreciative.




         Kris and I are here listening ... I am just sick to my stomach.



         Dan is grasping at anything to slam you ...         and Glen's cooking up what he's eating.
