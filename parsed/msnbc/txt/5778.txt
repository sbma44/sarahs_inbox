           Governor Palin,

           The SHARE campaign would like you to designate one of your commissioners as chair of the statewide
           campaign. Last year's chair was Bill Noll. Anna Bell describes it as a figure head position and mostly
           teleconferences involved. Whomever you designate I will let AnnaBell know and also contact that commissioner.

           Thanks,

           Ivy

           Last year's chair was Commissioner William Noll. (Very little time, Mostly figure head) For time and some of what
           it takes talk with Dorie Choquette 465-3666, she was the State wide coordinator two years ago and did an
           outstanding job. A lot is done thru tele-conference and emails. The Steering Committee is the only committee
           that has meetings and that is just to get the things in line and going. And we usually hold those meetings here at
           United Way and tele-conference the other locations.

           Anna Bell,

           Thank you for the email. Who was the chair last year? What is the time commitment? Where are the meetings?
           These are the things I will need to know before I sit down and discuss with Governor Palin who she will designate
           to serve.

           Best regards,

           Ivy Frye

          Good Morning Ivy, I need to pick you brain. I work with the "SHARE CAMPAIGN", which is State Employee's
          campaign. Each year the Governor appoints one of their Commissioners to be State Wide chair and he in
          turn picks one of his people to be State wide Coordinator or assistant Chair or what ever they want to call them.
          Who do we need to speak with in order to have Governor Palin to appoint the Chair?
          Thank you for any help,
