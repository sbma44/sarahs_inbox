         Good morning,



         The Board of Ed chose to have a nationwide search. They had one the last

         time the commissioner's position needed to be filled as well.



         The commissioner's office sent me the timeline which I will forward to

         you in a separate email. Right now, they are looking at having face to

         face interviews with the finalists on July 30, at which point they will

         have a meeting with you to meet and approve their candidate. This

         appointment does not need legislative confirmation.



         If there are people that you want to have considered, please have them

         submit their applications to the Board.



         Lynne

         Hi guys!



         Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



         Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name(s) to me for selection, then

         on to the legislature for confirmation.



         We need innovation in that seat . Both your names brought forward are

         great . Not sure why Ed Bd thinks it needs a nationwide search ,                which I

         heard recently .    I'll ask Lynne Smith to check the status on that and ask

         what my input is worth in terms of their method of soliciting names.



         Thank you guys . You're awesome . Keep up the great work - I miss (six

         months later ) our of rag - tag team of hardcore workerbees . Maybe the

         crew can get together for a shin dig soon? I know Kris and Todd miss

         the campaign folks too . Six months zipped by - I'd love for us all

         together . Don Benson, Mark Fish , Perdews, Mary , etc, all of us!
