   Governor - I am copying Mike Nizich in on this issue as I was not told that this was taking place. I was
   referring to Kami Clark which is our IT folk that had been asked to do this. Janice

  No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as it's not
  comforting at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who
  went to the bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th
  event that occurred while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

  Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor's office computer
  folks and they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not
  available at the time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned
  back to the house. All of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend. I was told that the
  department of law had asked for this. Janice

  If anyone has an answer, pis let me know asap:
  I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails
  from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer?
  And what were the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on
  whatever day it was that this occurred. Thank you
