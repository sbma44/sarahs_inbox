                   Subject: RDC speech

                 I shared a platform at the RDC conference today with Jim Bowles, Doug Suttles (BP), Mitch
                          (Marathon's new Alaska person), and an exec from Anadarko. It was a full house at
                 the RDC. My speech focused only briefly on ACES, AGIA, and then went to spending policy
                 and state permitting challenges (water/mining initiatives), and potential ESA listings (as threats
                 to the federal permitting processes).

                 Bottom line.. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                Privilege or Personal Material Redacted
                        d                                               ovules threw ese num ers out to the
                crowd. He said that under PPT is year, they gure the state would get $3.4 billion, under
                ACES about 4.2 billion, and under the House version about 5.1 billion.

                 I did mention publicly that I hoped the legislature would moderate its stance and come back
                 closer to your original proposal (though it appears there's little chance of that happening).
                  When Ch 2 asked if you supported the House version, I said that you were pleased with
                 progress in the House moving a bill over to the Senate and that the Administration sees this as
                 an ongoing conversation until both the House and Senate action is complete.
