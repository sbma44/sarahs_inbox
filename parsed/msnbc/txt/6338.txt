             Subject : Arts Council

           I talked with Ben Brown and he gave me the following description of the function of the Arts Council.
           The Council does manage the I% public art program. Wanted to pass this on since you asked last
           week. Thanks.

           The Alaska State Council on the Arts is a State agency that fosters the development of the arts for all
           Alaskans through education, partnerships, grants and services [our formal mission statement]. Every
           state and territory has an arts council of some sort, all of which were founded in response to Congress's
           creating the National Endowment for the Arts about 40 years ago. The Alaska State Council is a
           granting agency, distributing funds received mostly from the Alaska Legislature and NEA to arts
           organizations and individual artists. These range from small grants to help artists advance their careers
           and help small organizations have community workshops to larger ones that help organizations like
           Perseverance Theatre and Valley Performing Arts provide enriching artistic acivities in their
           communities.

           The Council manages the State's Contemporary Art Bank, which loans art to public offices, and the 1 %
           for Art public-art program, which builds art into public buildings and facilities (including the Marine
           Highway vessels). The Council is very interested in making sure Alaska's schoolchildren benefit from
           the arts in their classroom environments, and has a strong program called Artists-in-Schools which sends
           Alaskan artists to schools all over Alaska for one- or two-week intensive residencies that teach the
           children new artistic skills and also instructs teachers in how to integrate arts into more classroom
           activities. The Alaska State Council on the Arts also serves as a resource for local arts agencies (like the
           Juneau Arts & Humanities Council) so these closer-to-home arts organizations can foster a high level of
           all sorts of arts (literary, visual, performing) in each Alaskan community. One other activity is the
           Silver Hand Program, which helps authenticate Alaska Native art to prevent fraud and to augment the
           economic vitality of this uniquely Alaskan commodity.

          To: Bill Hogan
          DHSS Deputy Commissioner
          Re: Records and Licensing Department


          I would like to address a problem with records and licensing , this being the amount of time it takes
          to get a provisional clearance for a new hire-employee in assisted living , and costs associated
          with these delays.

          On 6/18/07 an application was submitted for a new employee (initials V. C.) and to date do not
          have a provisional clearance . When we call licensing all they say is that they are waiting for
          paperwork from another agency . We have 4 employees at this location so 1 person of this is 25%
          of my workforce, which has to be covered by the other employees as overtime . Let me explain
          the costs to us due to this failure of a timely clearence:

                1. Background fee, CPR training, and TB tine test.                       $100.00
                2. 4 weeks of overtime pay.                                              $960.00
                3.24 hours new hire training                                             $264.00
                                                                 TOTAL                   $1,324.00

          The reason I included new hire training is because , Friday the employee called and said she
          couldn't wait any longer and had found another job, so the above figures are not correct . This is
          because we will spend the next 2 to 3 weeks looking for a new employee , training and certifying
          that person. This will just increase my overtime costs to already tired employees.

         This is not an isolated incident . Since this program has started 2 years ago , only 10 to 20% of our
         applications have been completed on time (48 hours), all the rest have taken at least 5 to 20
         days. I have had discussions with some other homes and they are having the same problems, will
         provide you the names if requested . Assisted Living homes are 24 hour operations , I believe that
         the homes in Anchorage have at least 20 to 30 people doing overtime , due to the failure of
         licensing issuing timely clearances . We can 't afford this as we haven 't even had a pay increase
         since the year 2000 , and is also wearing out our other employees , because we can't put an
         employee on the shift till they have clearance.

         When I call licensing some of the excuses I get are: We are shorthanded , and we are
         overwhelmed with applications . The problem is that this has been the same excuse since they
         opened 2 years ago. Is it ever going to be fixed? Prior to this system , we had the potential
         employee go to the state trooper office and pull a name check and return it to us. We would then
         check it against the barrier crime list, and then if . there were an issue with it we would call



                                                                                                          PRA_GSP01_0003409

          licensing. THIS PROCEDURE TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES. This is the same data being used
          now, why the delay?
          My suggestion for change is that it be mandated that we have to be given yes or no clearance
          within 5 days or an exact explanation why not (no we're waiting) so the homes can consider other
          options. It is time the state stands up and takes responsibility for it's lack of action and the strain it
          is putting on the assisted living community.

          Please inform me if you intend to fix this problem and when or where I have to go for corrective
          action.

          Sincerely,
