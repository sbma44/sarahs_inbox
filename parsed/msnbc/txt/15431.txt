          I had no info on this until janice "reminded" me last night, she must have assumed I had
          all the info. Who's the other premier to be called? When? Phone number?

           Janice,

           Joe Balash and I thought it a good idea for the Governor to talk personally to the two
          Premiers in order to tell them that her two Commissioners (of DNR & Revenue) had
          determined that TransCanada Alaska's project (as presented in their AGIA' application)
          maximized Alaska's interests and would move the Alaska Gasline project forward. And,
          furthermore, the Governor and the Commissioners would be forwarding to Alaska's
          Legislature a recommendation to approve the recommendation that an AGIA License be issued
          to TransCanada.



           I hope this is helpful.

           Marty

          Sorry, I did not scroll down far enough to see the question. I have an idea about how
         the discussion should go, but would not want to steer anybody wrong. Marty, who is
         copied, should answer this question, as it was Marty who determined that the Governor
         should make these two Premier calls. Sorry I am not of any assistance.

          Yes, this is all set up. She will be making calls to both Premiers Fentie and Campbell
         in the morning. I am fairly certain that Kris and Janice are aware of these two calls,
         but am copying them in case.

           any questions. I don't know about a specific meeting request from her. KJR

           I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
          they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



           Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
          ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
          mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
          one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
          Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
