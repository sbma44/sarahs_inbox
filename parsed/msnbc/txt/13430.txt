            Governor - We just received a phone call from Darwin in Senator Green's office. Senator
            Green is in Texas and would like to talk to you about special session. She is changing
            planes and has on hour available from 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. (AK Time) to talk with you.
            Unfortunately her cell phone is not working in Texas and so we would need to have her call
            into a number to reach you if you are. available during that time period. Thanks, Janice
