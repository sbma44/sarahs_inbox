           Governor Palin,



           I graduated from Chugiak High School two years behind you (actually, you

           and I played basketball together once), you know my mother (Kathleen

           Kuersten, who directed the Miss Alaskan Scholarship Pageant when you

           ran) and I am a native Alaskan.



           I am also a political science professor. at a large school in the

          midwest.      I am a specialist in gender and politics. As you can imagine,

          like the rest of the country, I'm fascinated by your story.



          I know it's a long shot that you'll ever get this email, but I'd like to

          write a book about you. Would you agree to let me follow you on your

          road to the White House? I can.give you my credentials as an Alaskan

          and as a scholar. The media obviously doesn't get the story about about

          you, and the rest of the country isn't quite clear on how a woman can be

          smart.      You're making history and I'd like to document it.



          Thanks.
                                                              1

               Congrats Gov,
              Too bad you are not the GOP prez candidate...

              I'm independent and just want to say what many of my kind are looking to see :
              Allow the Bible and the Constitution be your statesmanship guide ; Not the winds of liberal consensus.

              What disgusts us most is politicians changing color once in Washington . I Example, claiming to be a firm 2d
              Amendment supporter ; then supporting strong restrictions , taxes, ban zones etc on some Constitutional virtue.
              Your record shows you as a stalwart Thank God .
              Hold to your principles even if alone

              Sincerely

              NCLB UPDATE

              As school gets underway, Secretary Spellings continues to offer states the opportunity for greater flexibility
              under the No Child Left BehindAct. Earlier this month, she reopened the differentiated accountability pilot

              letter to Chief State School Officers (http://www.ed.gov/poh'cv/gen /guid/secletter /080818.html), she
              again invited states to submit proposals that incorporate a measure of individual student growth into their

              system, while still adhering to the goal of 100% proficiency by 2013-14." So far, 11 states have been
              approved to implement their models under the pilot program . Proposals are due by October 15.
              Department officials will conduct an initial review of each proposal to make sure the growth model meets
              seven core principles and the state is making progress in specific areas . If they have any questions regarding
              a state's proposal, they will contact the state by October 24 and request the state respond by November 7.
              Then, those proposals determined to have met requirements will be forwarded to a team of peer reviewers,
              who will meet by early December. The Secretary anticipates reaching a final decision later in December.

              Concerning states, a new report from the National Center for Education Statistics (LACES), "Public School
              Graduates and Dropouts from the Common Core of Data: School Year 2005-06," presents the number of
              high school graduates, the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR), and dropout data for grades 9-12.
              Across 48 reporting states, a total of 2,649,001 public school students received a high school diploma in
              2005-06, resulting in an AFGR of 73.4%. However, the AFGR ranged drastically; 14 states had rates of
              80% or higher, while 10 states had rates below 70%. Similarly, the AFGR was much higher for
              Asian/Pacific Islander (89.6%) and white, non-Hispanic (80.6%) students than American Indian/Alaska
              Native (61.8%), Hispanic (61.4%), and black, non-Hispanic (59.1%) students. On the other end of the
              spectrum, once more across 48 reporting states, 579,000 public school students dropped out in 2005-06,
              resulting in an "event" dropout rate of 4%. Twelve states had dropout rates of less than 3%, while six states
              had rates of more than 6%. (Among those states for which comparisons could be made between 2002-03
              and 2005-06, the event dropout rate increased for 27 states and decreased for 21 states.) American
              Indian/Alaska Native students had the highest dropout rate at 7.4%, followed by black (6.1 %), Hispanic
              (6.0%), white (2.7%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (2.4%) students. FOR MORE INFORMATION,

              MEASURING PROGRESS, REALIZING RESULTS

              A Back to School edition of "Education News Parents Can Use " (September 16, 8:00-9:00 p.m. ET) will
              profile key strategies for improving student academic achievement and showcase schools that have proven
              successful in closing the achievement gap and helping all students perform at high levels . Educators know
              that what gets measured gets done, and information is a powerful catalyst for change . The more
              information one has, the better able one is to demand improvement -- and get it. The No Child Left Behind
              Act's focus on data dissemination and informed decision -making has helped transform the roles of parents
              and teachers. Parents now have the necessary information to be effective education consumers and
              advocates for their children. And, teachers have access to the latest data and scientifically proven strategies
              for helping students achieve. The outcome is a new, results-based culture in American schools. The
              broadcast will also spotlight the Department's Teaching Ambassador Fellowship program. The fellows -
              classroom teachers on leave from their schools to work on policy at the U .S. Department of Education -

              HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT

              On August 14, President Bush signed into law the HigberEducation OpportunityAct (HEOA), reauthorizing
              the original HigherEducationAct (HEA). The legislation covers most of the programs administered by the
              Departmnent's Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) and Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA).
              Therefore, OPE has dedicated a new web site (htW://www.ed.gov/poligy/bighm-ed&egZheaO8b, with
              information on the Department's implementation of the HEOA. Some updates:

                  · Dear Colleague Letter. The agency will be publishing a letter with a summary of each provision of
                    the HEOA. However, affected parties are responsible for taking the steps necessary to comply by the
                    effective dates established by the law. The provisions were effective upon enactment, unless
                    otherwise indicated.
                  · Negotiated Rulemaking. The agency will soon start the negotiated rulemaking process for parts of
                    the HEOA. Negotiated rulemaking is required for the development of all regulations implementing
                    statutory changes to Title IV of the HEA. Moreover, Section 201 of the HEOA added a provision to
                    Section 207(c) of the HEA requiring negotiated rulemaking for any regulations the Secretary develops
                    under amended Section 207(b)(2) of the HEA. This section prohibits a teacher preparation program
                    that has had its eligibility terminated by the state from accepting or enrolling any student who receives
                    Title IV aid.
                    Public Meetings. Starting next month, the agency will begin the negotiated rulemaking process by
                    publishing a notice in the Federal Register announcing public meetings where parties can suggest issues,
                    related to the HEOA that should be considered for action by these rulemaking committees. (Of
                    course, for anyone unable to attend a hearing, the Department will be accepting written comments)
                    Currently, the meetings will be held: 9/19 at Texas Christian University (Fort Worth, TX); 9/29 at the
                    University of Rhode Island's Providence Campus; 10/2 at Pepperdine University (Malibu, CA); 10/6
                    at Johnson C. Smith University (Charlotte, NC); 10/8 at the U.S. Department of Education's K Street
                    conference center (Washington, DC); and 10/15 at Cuyahoga Community College (Cleveland, OH).
                    Additional information on these hearings will be posted as it becomes available.



              Be sure to check back oftenl As the Department moves through the implementation process, OPE will be
              updating the web site.

              Also: This year's special supplement to NCES's "Condition of Education 2008" report (see
              http://nces.ed.gQv/programs/coe provides a rich profile of the more than 1,000 community colleges in
              the U.S., analyzes the characteristics of students who entered community college from high. schools, and
              examines the rates of persistence and attainment among community college students in general. It also
              directly compares public, two-year institutions with public and private four-year colleges and universities.
              Among high school seniors who enrolled immediately in a postsecondary institution in 2004, 30% enrolled
              in a community college. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

               Much like the ACT scores detailed last issue, despite a record number of students taking the test - including
               a higher percentage (36%) of first-generation students than 2007 and a substantial rate (40%) of minority
               participation - the 2008 SAT national average composite score was 1511 (on a scale of 600 to 2400), the
               same as last year' s score. Average scores for all three sections of the test were also identical to 2007: 502 in
               reading, 515 in math, and 494 in writing. (Each section has a minimum score of 200 and a maximum score
               of 800.) Females have narrowed the performance gap with males in reading, closing to within four points,
               and females outperform males on the writing test by 13 points. However, males still outperform females by
               33 points on the math test. Meanwhile, according to multiple studies, writing has proven the most
               predictive section of the SAT for determining first-year college performance, both for all students and
               across all racial/ethnic groups, demonstrating that writing is a critical skill. FOR MORE INFORMATION,

               QUOTE TO' NOTE

               "Two centuries after Abraham Lincoln's birth, the nation is still in formation. The U.S. has grown and
              expanded. One cost of that growth has been a splintering of many parts of our society . Competing values,
              interests, and beliefs have complicated Lincoln 's goal to find unity in our diversity. The bicentennial
              commemoration of his life and legacy - through various education programs , public forums , and arts
              projects - will be a bright beacon to completing our nation 's 'unfinished work.'"
