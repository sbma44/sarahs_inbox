        Barrow also has June whaling events and I could possibly get back up there for one of them
        if I have enough lead time. Kris can check perhaps be I'd probably be leaving from Anch.
        Kris - could you check on Barrow, also any solstice events elsewhere? Maybe Melissa or
        Susan could help you find these Alaskan events that I should be traveling to?



        Bit- I'm happy to sign bills in any of the communities. And the AO that will form the
        Native Elder Council of Dyson's.




        Also Bit- pls touch base w/Harris on special session logisitics - and Sr Care issue be I
        heard him on the news last nite sort of punting it back to us in terms of spec session for
        Sr Care (he said he was going to talk to me about it?), and we know we'll have the ppt sp
        session also. Pls let him know my intention of calling it in Anch. Kris is going to run
        this by Hickle and Malcolm re: Cpt Cook facilities as the IWC was held there wonderfully.
        (Or a public school tha',s sitting empty all summer?!)

        We need to wk with DOR and DNR on timing of ppt session.

        And Dept of Law.



        Kari- pls add to schedule my drop-by at ML&P this morn before airport. Thanks!



        Meg- if track cant get off work to travel to the Blessing of the Fleet on Saturday, do you
        want to send AP guy in his King Air seat instead? Quinn's asked me to let him travel with
        us somewhere rural. Can anyone think of a few talking pts for the First Dude's "Blessing
        of..." remarks? I can add to them if we've got a few started. Thanks!

        No one is asking about Shell, just following up on your email from last

        night.     Golden Days in FBX are during your NGA Michigan trip July 20-22.
