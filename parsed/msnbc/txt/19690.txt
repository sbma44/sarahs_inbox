             Subject:                 Copy of statement sent to Megan Holland


             Per Rosanne and Sharon , this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland at the ADN.




             Former Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan
             Holland.  My response to those questions follows:



             Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to
             staffing and recruitment and retention.   Like the legislature, I was focused and aware of
             a lack of results in recruiting and retention. Action and results, not words are the
             bottom line.  For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the
             troopers with nearly 1 in 7 positions being unfilled. There were 56 vacancies as of June
             30, 2008. I was also aware that regardless of any plans of Mr. Monegan's, no new
             positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were filled, which made it
             even more important to get the job done.



            Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual report. I was aware of the
            draft and in fact, had several questions about it that Mr. Monegan never answered. My
            special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft. The fact that Mr.
            Monegan prepared a detailed draft written report of the troopers' activities in 2007 does
            not change the bottom line or lack of results under Mr. Monegan..



            Mr. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him. This is wrong. In addition to
            several face-to-face meetings, Walt and I spent much more time together discussing the
            future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate action. Remember that
            Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at events throughout the state,
            including one-on-one time together on the state's plane traveling to the bush. That's in
            addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that I
            personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four opportunities with me in 17 months
            to discuss public safety is untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations
            that my staff had with Walt on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow
            Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special
            Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a

             meeting,   a phone call, or any type of conversation.



            While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state's business on
            all other fronts as well, and will continue to do so.




                                                                   1

               Governor - I can not verify the exact number of trips without looking at the whole scheduling file. I can not get into
               the calendar system that we used prior to outlook without going into the office and looking through the hard copies.
               I will gladly go in to look through scheduling but this will take some time and that would probably not include the
               cabinet meetings, etc. Janice

               Most of the statement is in the there toward the bottom - I had switched the order of paragraphs to emphasize what
               was most important and that is the number of times that you've met with Walt. The main thing missing is a summary
               of your four trips seated together to rural Alaska and your days together in Bethel, New Stu (twice), and
               Dillingham. Also, we reworked the last statement re: AGIA.

               Below is what you approved Governor - for use tomorrow by anyone who needs to reiterate your points.

               Thanks,

                First, regarding the number of meetings rve had with Walt over the last year and a half, in addition to several face-to-face
                meetings, Walt and I spent
                much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate action.
                Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at events throughout the state, including four trips
                to rural Alaska seated together on the plane. During those trips to Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham, we also spent
                our days together. That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that rve
                personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four face-to-face meetings with me in 17 months to discuss public safety is
                untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staffhad with Walt, on my behalf, including meetings
                and conversations with fellow Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special
                Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a meeting, 'A phone call, or any type of
                conversation.


                Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware that he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment and
                retention. I would assume those plans are the same ones we discussed in those events and meetings, during Cabinet
                meetings, and on the plane, among other places. Those plans mirrored my thoughts and ideas to get more troopers and tackle
                the alcohol problem. That's why the ideas remain behind Kopp - only I expect immediate action in this new direction, not
                just another reminder of our plans. Regarding the draft 2007 annual report. My staff has advised that a copy of a lengthy
                draft report was provided by him for review by the special assistant and Chief-of-Staff. Again, though, Fm ready for results.
                And so are the people of this state.


                AGIA has been appropriately time consuming . AGIA is our future; the gasline is the financial security for the future of our
                state. The revenue from the gasline will pay for our essentials, including public safety . However, the time spent on AGIA
                over the last year and a half has not been to the detriment of ANY department or its missions... and all the more reason to
                have high expectations that I have self-starters and results -oriented cabinet members.

                Per Rosanne and Sharon, this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland nbsp;




                Former Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan Holland. My response to those
                questions follows:

                Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment and
                retention. Like the legislature , I was focused and aware of a lack of results in recruiting and retention . Action and results,
                not words are the bottom line. For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the troopers with nearly I
                in 7 positions being unfilled. There were 56 vacancies as of June 30, 2008. 1 was also aware that regardless of any plans of
                Mr. Monegan's, no new positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were filled, which made it even more
                important to get the job done.

                Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual of the draft and in fact , had several questions about it that Mr.
                Monegan never answered . My special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft. The fact that Mr. Monegan
                prepared a detailed draft written report of the troopers' activities in 2007 does not change the bottom line or lack of results
                under Mr. Monegan.

                Mr. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him. This is wrong. In addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt
                and I spent much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate
                action. Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities , dozens of discussions at events throughout the state , including
                one-on-one time together on the state 's plane traveling to the bush. That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every
                reception, other trips, and phone calls that I personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four opportunities with m
                public safety is untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with Walt on my behalf,
                including meetings and conversations with fellow Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney
                General, Special Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a
                 meeting, a phone call, or any type of conversation.

                While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state's business on all other fronts as well, and will
                continue to do so.

               Most of the statement is in the there toward the bottom - I had switched the order of paragraphs to
               emphasize what was most important and that is the number of times that you've met with Walt . The main
               thing missing is a summary of your four trips seated together to rural Alaska and your days together in
               Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham. Also, we reworked the last statement re: AGIA.

               Below is what you approved Governor - for use tomorrow by anyone who needs to reiterate your points.

               Thanks,
               Meg


               First, regarding the number of meetings I've had with Walt over the last year and a half, in
               addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt and I spent
               much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for
               immediate action. Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at
               events throughout the state, including four trips to rural Alaska seated together on the plane.
               During those trips to Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham, we also spent our days together.
               That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that I've
               personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four face-to-face meetings with me in 17
               months to discuss public safety is untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations
               that my staff had with Walt, on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow
               Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants,
               etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a meeting, a phone call, or any
               type of conversation.


               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware that he had several various plans in the works related to
               staffing and recruitment and retention. I would assume those plans are the same ones we
               discussed in those events and meetings, during Cabinet meetings, and on the plane, among other
               places. Those plans mirrored my thoughts and ideas to get more troopers and tackle the alcohol
               problem. That's why the ideas remain behind Kopp - only I expect immediate action in this new
               direction, not just another reminder of our plans. Regarding the draft 2007 annual report. My
               staff has advised that a copy of a lengthy draft report was provided by him for review by the
               special assistant and Chief-of-Staff. Again, though, I'm ready for results. And so are the people
               of this state.


               AGIA has been appropriately time consuming. AGIA is our future; the gasline is the financial
               security for the future of our state. The revenue from the gasline will pay for our essentials,
               including public safety. However, the time spent on AGIA over the last year and a half has not
               been to the detriment of ANY department or its missions... and all the more reason to have high
               expectations that I have self-starters and results-oriented cabinet members.

                Most of the statement is in the there toward the bottom - I had switched the order of paragraphs to
                emphasize what was most important and that is the number of times that you 've met with Wait. The main
                thing missing is a summary of your four trips seated together to rural Alaska and your days together in
                Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham. Also, we reworked the last statement re: AGIA

                Below is what you approved Governor - for use tomorrow by anyone who needs to reiterate your points.

               Thanks,
               Meg


               First, regarding the number of meetings I've had with Walt over the last year and a half, in
               addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt and I spent
               much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for
               immediate action. Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at
               events throughout the state, including four trips to rural Alaska seated together on the plane.
               During those trips to Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham, we also spent our days together.
               That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that I've
               personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four face-to-face meetings with me in 17
               months to discuss public safety is untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations
               that my staff had with Walt, on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow
               Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants,
               etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a meeting, a phone call, or any
               type of conversation.


               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware that he had several various plans in the works related to
               staffing and recruitment and retention. I would assume those plans are the same ones we
               discussed in those events and meetings, during Cabinet meetings, and on the plane, among other
               places. Those plans mirrored my thoughts and ideas to get more troopers and tackle the alcohol
               problem. That's why the ideas remain behind Kopp - only I expect immediate action in this new
               direction, not just another reminder of our plans. Regarding the draft 2007 annual report. My
               staff has advised that a copy of a lengthy draft report was provided by him for review by the

                special assistant and Chief-of-Staff. Again, though, I'm ready for results. And so are the people of this
                state.


               AGIA has been appropriately time consuming. AGIA is our future; the gasline is the financial security
               for the fixture of our state. The revenue from the gasline will pay for our essentials, including public
               safety. However, the time spent on AGIA over the last year and a half has not been to the detriment of
               ANY department or its missions... and all the more reason to have high expectations that I have self-
               starters and results-oriented cabinet members.

               Per Rosanne and Sharon, this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland at the ADN.




               Former. Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan Holland. My response to those
               questions follows:

               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment and
               retention. Like the legislature, I was focused and aware of a lack of results in recruiting and retention. Action and results,
               not words are the bottom line. For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the troopers with nearly I
               in 7 positions being unfilled. There were 56 vacancies as of June 30, 2008. I was also aware that regardless of any plans of
               Mr. Monegan's, no new positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were filled, which made it even more
               important to get the job done.

               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual report. I was aware of the draft and in fact, had several
               questions about it that Mr. Monegan never answered. My special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft.
               The fact that Mr. Monegan prepared a detailed draft written report of the troopers' activities in 2007 does not change the

              bottom line or lack of results under Mr. Monegan.

              Mr. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him . This is wrong. In addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt
              and I spent much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate
              action. Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities , dozens of discussions at events throughout the state, including
              one-on-one time together on the state 's plane traveling to the bush . That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every
              reception, other trips, and phone calls that I personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four opportunities with me in
              17 months to discuss public safety is untruthful . Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with
              Walt on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow Commissioners , the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-
              Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a
               meeting, a phone call, or any type of conversation.

              While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state 's business on all other fronts as well, and will
              continue to do so.

               Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re : the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and his claim that it was only four.
                I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone call and face-to-face that I had with
               Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                 Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                 Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER
               refused any request to meet with any of us. He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG , also, in
               "communications " with me.
