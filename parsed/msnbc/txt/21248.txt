             41st Annual Fall Principals Conference, October 14-16
             Sponsored by the Alaska Associations of Elementary and Secondary
             Principals
             Conference Theme: Comprehensive School Improvement (CSI): Alaska

             10 a.m. Sheraton Hotel

             It is an honor to welcome all of you - our elementary and secondary
             principals. It is exciting to see so many of Alaska's educational leaders
             together learning new strategies to improve our schools.

             Your leadership is making a real difference in Alaska 's schools.

             There is no question, we are all faced with significant challenges when it
             comes to improving our schools. Some of the concerns I hear all across out
             state are (1) the impact of skyrocketing retirement costs, (2) the high cost
             of energy and (3) the inability of our districts to effectively plan with
             unpredictable levels of state support.

             I am working hard to address these issues . Last year, I called on the
             Legislature to pass an early education funding bill . Although we were not
             successful , we were able to make education a priority by placing $1 Billion
             into the Education Fund.

            The Legislative Education Funding Task Force has met and generated 18
            recommendations. In order to give our.districts the ability to better plan and
            budget for their programs, I again commit to working with the Legislature to
            adopt changes to our statutory foundation program early next session.

            Some of the changes in the report that I am particularly interested are:
              1. Updating our district cost factors to recognize the higher costs of
                  providing education in many areas of our state
              2. Increasing funding for students with intensive needs, so that our
                  students who experience medical or other special circumstances can
                  become successful in school and in life, and

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3


                 3. Increasing the Base Student Allocation in future years.


             Last year, the State contributed a significant amount to help local school districts
             and municipalities with increasing retirement costs . Although we're still working
             on our state budget for the next fiscal year , it will reflect my continuing support to
             fund the TRS and PERS shortfalls , so that school districts can focus on the
             educational needs of students.

             We have implemented, and continue to add, many initiatives that will help
             disengaged students become active participants in their education. It's vital that
             our students are able to take their place in our economy and share in Alaska's
             future. Our children are our greatest resource.

             In the near future, 3 out of 4 jobs in America will require some training after high
             school . Increasingly, the skills required for entry -level jobs are similar to the skills
             needed to enter college.

             Our goal is that more students will graduate from high school and will do so
             prepared to transition to many different opportunities in the workforce or
             postsecondary education.

             We are beginning a program , called Work Ready/College Ready , to help prepare
             students for college or the workplace. It offers students and adult job-seekers the
             opportunity to assess and improve their skills in three areas that are important to
             the workplace and post-secondary education : reading for information , applied
             math, and locating information in graphic formats.

             The online program is free to users , self-paced, and targeted to participants'
             needs . The curriculum and assessments are delivered in the context of work
             situations in fields in which students are interested.

             Students will be able to document their skills in a nationally recognized Career
             Readiness Certificate.

             While these initiatives are important , there many more challenges facing us all if
             we are going to be successful at addressing issues such as our graduation rates.

             I will look to you to help provide solutions that can make a difference . I stand
             ready to work with all of you - and I welcome your new ideas.

            Thank you all for the leadership you provide on the front lines of Alaska
            education.

             September 19-21, Secretary Spellings participated in a Back to School bus tour across Ohio and
             Indiana. On Day 1, in Cleveland, the Secretary announced the "Empowering Parents School
             Box" (htt-p://www.ed.gov/parents/academic/involve/schoolbox/), a resource to help families
             better prepare their students for academic success, as well as explored the Rock and Roll Hall of
             Fame (where she learned about science by singing a Stevie Wonder song) and hosted a live National
             Parent Town Hall. "No Child Left Behind puts a necessary focus on reading and math -- the gateway
             skills to all other learning," she said at the town hall meeting. "It also arms parents with the
             information they need to be smart consumers and strong advocates for their children. I have yet to
             meet a parent who volunteered his or her child to be the one who was left behind." On Day 2, the
             Secretary visited Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton (her assigned codename:
             Starbuck) and Withrow High School in Cincinnati, where she revealed new features of the

              background , perform in the top 10% on their state assessments (public] or nationally normed assessments
               [private]) and dramatically improving schools (schools whose students , at least 40% of whom are from
              disadvantaged backgrounds, dramatically improved on tests to score in at least the top 40% statewide ). Chief
              State School Officers nominate public schools . The Council for American Private Education nominates
              private schools . Of the schools nominated by each state, at least one-third must have more than 40% of
              their students from disadvantaged backgrounds , and all recipients must meet No Child Left Behind Adequate
              Yearly Progress (AYP) requirements , as defined by their states . The schools will be honored at a ceremony
              in Washington, D.C., November 12-13. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

               NAEP 2007

              On September 25, the non-partisan National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) released national and
              state- by-state results of the 2007 Nation's Report Card in reading and math , highlighting fourth- and eighth-
              grade achievement on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Some findings:

              Math --

                   Fourth- and eighth-graders scored higher than in all previous assessment years, and the proportion of
                    students performing at or above the "Basic " and "Proficient" achievement levels has increased
                    significantly over the last 17 years.
                   At both grades , white, black, and Hispanic students demonstrated a better understanding compared to
                    all previous assessment years . And, the white - black achievement gap narrowed at grade 4 when
                    compared to 1990 and at grade 8 when compared to 2005.
                   Fourteen states and the District of Columbia improved their scores at both the fourth- and eighth-
                    grade levels from 2005 to 2007, while no state showed a decline in achievement.


              Reading --

                   Fourth-graders scored higher than in all previous assessment years . Eighth-graders scored higher than
                    in 1992 and 2005.
                   At both grades, white, black, and Hispanic students demonstrated a better understanding compared to
                    1992. But, just the white -black achievement gap at grade 4 had narrowed compared to 1992 and 2005.
                   Three states and the District improved their scores at both the fourth - and eighth-grade levels from
                    2005 to 2007, while no states showed a decline in fourth- grade achievement and only two states
                    showed a decline in eighth-grade achievement.


             "Student achievement is on the rise," said the Secretary upon the release. "No Child Left Behind is working.
             It's doable, reasonable, and necessary. Any efforts to weaken accountability would fly in the face of rising
             achievement." FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO http ://nationsreportcard . gov/. (Several

              (IDEA). The report consists of two volumes . The first section of Volume I focuses on the children and
              students being served under IDEA, including trends in numbers and percentages of infants , toddlers,
              preschool, and school-age children served; declassification of elementary school-age students; and
              characteristics of secondary students served for emotional disturbance . The second section has state-level
              data profiles, and the third section consists of selected rank-ordered state data tables . Volume II contains
              extensive appendix tables of state-reported data required under IDEA, including the number of infants and
              toddlers receiving early intervention services disaggregated by race /ethnicity; the number of children
              receiving special education services disaggregated by disability category and race /ethnicity; and graduation
              and dropout data . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

              Note : OSERS's updated "Disability Employment 101" booklet
              (htm //www. ed.gov/about / offices /list/osers /products/employmentguide/) presents information on
              finding qualified workers with disabilities , putting disability and employment research into practice, and
              modeling what other businesses have done to successfully integrate those with disabilities into the workforce.



              TRANSFORMING HIGHER EDUCATION

              In early September, the Secretary announced that the national student loan default rate fell from FY 2004's
              5.1% to 4 .6% -- just off the record-low rate of 4.5% (FY 2003) and 79% less than the all -time high of 22.4%
              (FY 1990). Moreover , all of the nation 's colleges and universities have default rates low enough to remain
              eligible for federal financial aid programs . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO
              http: / /www.ed .gov/offices /OSFAP /defaultmanagement /cdr.html.

             On September 27, President Bush signed into law the College Cost Reduction andAccessAct (H.R. 2669),
             authorizing the largest increase in student financial aid since the GI Bill . The legislation increases funding for
             the federal Pell Grant program -- which, unlike loans, do not have to be repaid -- by $11.4 billion over the
             next five years, gradually raising the maximum annual award from $4, 310 in 2007 to $5,400 in 2012 . " One of
             the best ways to make higher education affordable is through Pell Grants," the President stated . "Pell Grants
             send an important message to students in need : if you work hard, and you stay in school, and you make the
             right choices , the federal government is going to stand with you." Today, five million lower-income students
             receive Pell Grants annually. In addition, the legislation makes it easier to repay loans by:

                  Cutting interest rates on new, subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students . (From the current
                   6.8%, the rate would be reduced to 6.0% in July 2008 , 5.6% in July 2009 , 4.5% in July 2010, and 3.4%
                   in July 2011 . In July 2012 , the rate would revert back to 6.8%.)
                  Capping both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loan repayments to no more than 15% of
                   discretionary income . After 25 years , any remaining balances would be cancelled.
                  Forgiving the loans of borrowers working public sector jobs (such as emergency management,
                   government, law enforcement , public education , public health) after 10 years of service and
                   repayments.

              KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE

             The next "Education News Parents Can Use" broadcast (October 16, 8:00-9:00 ET) will discuss "what
             works" in violence reduction and the growing body of evidence about the links between violence, bullying,
             mental health, and academic achievement. The Virginia Tech University tragedy, like the shootings at
             American middle and high schools , shocked the country and caused parents and educators to wonder how
             school campuses -- traditionally, safe havens for learning -- could become so violent. Actually, despite these
             highly visible events, the vast majority of the nation 's students are safe at school. Statistics indicate that
             homicides of school-age children were about 50 times more likely to occur away from school than at school,
             and, every year over the last decade, serious violent victimization rates were lower at school . Still, as long as
             any student is threatened, there is work to be done. The broadcast will spotlight a variety of resources to
             assist educators -- and help the parents they serve -- in developing and improving plans to mitigate violent
             behavior, identifying behaviors that lead to violence in youth, and ensuring the safety and prosperity of
             America's children. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             Regarding Virginia Tech, the Department's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools (OSDFS) recently awarded
             the institution a $960,685 grant to assist with recovery efforts and begin to develop a model for assessing and
             responding to at-risk behaviors in a higher education setting . After the April 16 shootings , Virginia Tech
             submitted an unsolicited proposal to OSDFS for national program /federal activities funds. These
             discretionary funds support leadership projects designed to prevent violence and drug abuse among all
             education levels . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             Also, as a participating member of the President ' s Interagency Task Force to combat human trafficking,
             OSDFS has developed a fact sheet for schools related to the trafficking of children. Contrary to popular
             assumption, cases of human trafficking have been reported in all 50 states , the District of Columbia, and
             some U.S. territories. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

             Financial Officer issued new guidance for the "late liquidation " of federal education funds.



             ADULT EDUCATION

             On September 27, President Bush signed an Executive Order to strengthen adult education in the U.S.
             Secretary Spellings has been tasked with leading an Interagency Adult Education Working Group. By
             bringing together all relevant federal agencies , the group aims to strengthen existing programs and improve
             adult participation in postsecondary education. "College access is not just about access for high school
             students . It's about access for adult learners ," the Secretary said . "When 90% of the fastest growing jobs in
             America require a postsecondary credential or training, we have a duty to educate those of all ages and
             backgrounds to meet the needs of our new knowledge -based economy ." FOR MORE INFORMATION,
             PLEASE GO TO http://www.ed.gov/news /pressreleases /2007/09/09282007a.html.


             Note: To support states and colleges that are working to increase adults' access to an advanced credential, the
             Secretary also announced four grants totaling more than $2.8 million from the Department's Office of
             Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE). Ready for College grants will allow community college systems in
             four states to work with 25 local adult education programs to improve college readiness for out -of-school

              QUOTES TO NOTE

              "The Nation's Report Card shows we're making good progress .... And that means Congress needs to
              reauthorize and strengthen the No Child Left BehindAct.... Through this law our nation has made an historic
              commitment to America 's children, and we have a moral obligation to keep that commitment. We must
              ensure that they have the skills they need to succeed in life -- and in a global economy that becomes even
              more important."

              -- President George W. Bush (9/26/07), in New York City after the release of 2007 NAEP scores

              "This morning, I had the honor of meeting the Team USA athletes, including golfer Jason Plante. In
              addition to competing here today, he is an honor roll student, and he also plays on his high school team,
              which is among the best in the state. In Jason's opinion, 'there is virtually no difference' between learning a
              sport and learning in school. He's absolutely right. Both take discipline, focus, practice, and high
              expectations. This summit [on the Well-Being of Students with Intellectual Disabilities] is a great opportunity
              for all of us to work together to help more students around the world succeed and thrive as Jason has."
