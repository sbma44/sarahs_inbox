             Sharon- pls see note to Ivy in this email re: Juneau Empire story today. We've been really
             trying to reign in living expenses to try to set an example for other depts - glad Pat F
             picked up at least on the travel expenses... there's a lot more to illustrate the
             committment to doing things different, better, more economically in our admin. Ivy and I
             had recently been discussing this... if it's something AP or ADN follows up on after Pat's
             story, I'd be happy to talk to reporters about it. Not to be self-serving, but to show how
             we believe every little bit will help - everything adds up.

             If the new cheese manufacturer wants us to do anything with them to help kick off their
             venture(if you think it's a good idea), pis ket Kyle know we can come cut a ribbon or
             something when session ends. Does Franci support this venture? Kristan?



             Ivy- there's a good Juneau E article about travel costs plummeting since we got elected.
             If AP elaborates on it we can point out othere reductions in costs/living expensives like
             travel, security detail, housing expenses (the state doesn't rent an Anchorage apartment
             anymore), food and entertainment, etc. Just an idea for Quinn to show we're trying to
             reign it in.
