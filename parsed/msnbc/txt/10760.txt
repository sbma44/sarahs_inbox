               It's confusing- the ADN has been such a stickler making sure EVERYTHING I've ever written
               in an op-ed is factual, but then has inconsistently allowed Halcro and Fagan to print bs
               in their op-eds as recently as yesterday and today.




              Halcro- stating I said I "didn't understand the budget", thus didn't cut $150m as I said.
              I've NEVER said I didn't understand the budget, that's total bs - why would I claim that?



              Fagan- stating he called me during the campaign after he had lunch w/oil industry and I
              asked "what lies are they telling now?". Hmmmmm, sure don't recall that- but I do recall
              Fagan claiming on his show that he NEVER had/has lunch with. industry folks.



              Sharon- if ever you get to talk to ADN about this, pls do. Can their columnists print
              anything without verification, but our op-eds are scrutinized so thoroughly before
              printing?
