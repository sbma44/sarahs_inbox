        Governor:




        I want to extend an open invitation to you, Todd, and members of your staff to visit or
        participate in any of the activities, field camps, special use areas, or surveys conducted
        or managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. For example, as commissioner I am
        allowed to issue special permits for visitors (outside of the regular public lottery) to
        the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary for world-class viewing of coastal brown bears.
         Also, we conduct a number of interesting field projects ( e.g., moose and caribou aerial
        surveys, radio-tagging of northern pike, stream-walk spawning surveys for salmon,
        medicinal baiting of wolves, etc.) that you could visit and join in. Your participation
        would not only be a boon to ADF&G staff, but also a way for you to become more acquainted
        with our programs and to see some of the lesser-visited portions of Alaska.




        Some particular ideas include:



                                                               1




                                                                                                         PRA GSP01_0002120

        In a few weeks, the department in conjunction with the Hunter Heritage Foundation is
        conducting a weekend workshop of training activities called "Becoming an Outdoors Woman."
         BOW has become a very popular program, and I will be attending a portion of this June's
        program (June 15-17) at Lost Lake south of Fairbanks. As Alaska's premier "outdoors
        woman" you would certainly be a welcome addition to this, or any future, program. Soon,
        we will likely be holding a BOW training session in Southeast Alaska.    For information,
        please see:  http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/Region3/ Programs /BOW/BOWhome.cfm




        While this year's permits have already been issued, if you would like to visit the McNeil
        River bear-viewing program in lower Cook Inlet, I would be happy to reserve slots for you
        next year.   For more information, see: http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?
        adfg=mcneil_river. main




        Or, perhaps we could arrange a trip for you and Todd this year or next to visit the Round
        Island (Walrus . Islands). State Game Sanctuary, west of Togiak, in association with your
        fishing season in Dillingham: http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=refuge.rnd_is




        Or, perhaps a trip into the upper portions of the Bristol Bay drainages, to witness some
        of Alaska's premier trout sport fisheries:
        http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/region2/areas/index.cfm/FA/BB.overview




        Another trip idea would be to visit Kodiak, perhaps meet with fishermen, and then fly by
        charter to the south end of the Island to view the set gill net and purse seine sockeye
        salmon fishery enroute to our Frazer Lake fishpass, where there are not only brown bears
        but also thousands of sockeye salmon ascending a fish ladder around a natural barrier
        falls.  while passing through Kodiak city, it might be possible to arrange a short trip on
        a small, local trawl or longline vessel, as well as visit some of the state and federal
        research and management facilities.  For a bit on the Frazer facility and program:
        http://www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/region4/finfish/salmon/kodiak/frazer_res.php




        This fall you might be interested in joining me on a potential trip to the Noatak and
        Kobuk Rivers, out of Kotzebue, in order to see the massive Northwest Arctic caribou herd
        and to see firsthand some of the contentious guide/outfitter/subsistence hunter conflicts
                                                       2




                                                                                                  PRA_GSP01 _0002121

        occurring in that part of the state . And, there are certainly opportunities for me to
        help arrange for you to visit any of the national parks , national wildlife refuges, etc.
        around the state.




        More locally , there are opportunities for day trips , say to our fish wheel salmon counting
        program at Canyon Island on the Taku River south of Juneau in the mountains near the
        US/Canada border, or to our weir and fish wheel programs on the Chilkat and Chilkoot
        Rivers near Haines , overflights of some of the local commercial fisheries , or visits to
        local salmon hatcheries.




        If any of this strikes your fancy , please let me know ,     and we will work to accommodate
        your schedule and preferences.




        Thanks, DL.
