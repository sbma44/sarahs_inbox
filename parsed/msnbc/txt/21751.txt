                Mike,

                At the AML meeting , Mayor Williams of Ketchikan stood up and asked whether a deal would
                be completed between the state and Ketchikan to keep the Marine Highway System hq in
                Ketchikan. I told him that you were a better one to answer that question than I as I have not
                been involved in discussions over the issue. Can you please call him and talk with him about
                the issue. Thank you.
