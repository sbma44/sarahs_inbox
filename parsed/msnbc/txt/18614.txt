         Yes he can call me. Ask Joe if there's any "ask" on Shell's part. I don't know if Shell
         has appreciated our efforts on development's half that should have been acknowledged. DEC
         and DNR have really gone to bat for them, but we've only gotten grief for our efforts. Is
         Shell calling to ask for additional assistance?

         Subject: Telephone Call - John Hofineister, Shell U.S. Country Chair




         Governor - John Hofmeister, Shell's U.S. Country Chair, would like to call you today to
         provide an update on their 07 Exploration plans. Per Joe Balash they are looking to
         inform you that Shell is reducing its workforce in Alaska due to their inability to win
         relief from the 9th Circuit or to complete their permits.



         Please let me know if an 11:30 a.m. call from Mr. Hofmeister would be okay and I will
         arrange with his office.  Thank you, Janice
