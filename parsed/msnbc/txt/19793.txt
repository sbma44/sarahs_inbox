               Yep. So however many cabinet mtgs (and receptions) we've had, count those as opportunities
               too.

     i          mentions those trips we know occurred that she has been able to conl:um. Do you want to see this before I

                It began with the 5 :00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a memo from the

                 department the city removed Chuck from all supervisory duties. They made it quite sinister as you can
                 expect like there is still something that he and the city was hiding.

                 I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through this with
                 me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on the phone with the City of Kenai attorney's
                 office working on a strategy.

                 The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human resource response when
                 you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to sexual harassment, you remove
                 immediately the person from the any of supervisory duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this
                 woman) until you can substantiate or unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the
                 claim and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.

                 Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he can and
                 set the record straight. He will have the city Mayor by his side and she will attest to the situation in favor of
                 Chuck. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                 That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in the
                 morning with some more follow up.

                My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a
                press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be
                standing with him? If there are any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what
                prompted this new action, etc.
                  He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good
                Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.

               Thanks for taking the Governor's call and for reading these emails. I know that reporters on
               certain beats can amend stories late into the night in some cases . And while I know that it's very
               late and not an ideal situation , any opportunity that you can provide for the Governor's facts to
               come out, that would be great As you know, situations like the trips are documented by the state
               and cannot be denied.

               With that in mind , the Governor wanted me to make sure that she also added a comment about
               her trips to rural communities with Walt. And so she asked that I pass along to you as well,
               following your phone conversation with her.

               meetings , receptions throughout the state , and phone calls, among other things."

               And one more thought regarding AGIA:
               "AGIA has been appropriately time consuming . AGIA is our future; the gasline is the financial security for
               the future of our state . The revenue from the gasline will help pay for our essentials , including public
               safety. However, the time spent on AGIA over the last year and a half has not been to the detriment of
               ANY department or its missions ... and all the more reason to have high expectations that I have self-
               starters and results-oriented cabinet members."



               Thanks, Megan.

              our two visits to New Stu in January and June of 2007 and during our trip to Bethel in January of 2008.
              And that's in addition to other meetings that I mentioned such as face -to-face meetings, cabinet
              meetings, receptions throughout the state , and phone calls, among other things."

              And one more thought regarding AGIA:
              "AGIA has been appropriately time consuming. AGIA Is our future; the gasline is the financial security for
              the future of our state. The revenue from the gasline will help pay for our essentials , including public
              safety. However, the time spent on AGIA over the last year and a half has not been to the detriment of
              ANY department or its missions ... and all the more reason to have high expectations that I have self-
              starters and results-oriented cabinet members."

              those trips we know occurred that she has been able to confirm. Do you want to see this before I send it on to Megan
              Holland? Or, as Meghan has suggested, can I send it in a new seperat e e-mail to Megan?

              Thank you. Best if has mayor porter and manager koch with him. He MUST be candid, honest and must ask to be held
              accountable because he has nothing to hide as he tells truthfully of the situation... is my opinion based on what I've been told.
              I have no reason to NOT believe him based on info I am aware of... now Alaskans need to hear clearly why he is to be
              believed. Solid and strong and truthful. (I hope he realizes how bad some folks want to crucify us - he needs to be strong. )

              Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at public safety.

              It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a memo from the City of Kenai
              written by the city attorney indicating that when the allegation/complaint came into the department the city removed Chuck
              from all supervisory duties. They made it quite sinister as you can expect like there is still something that he and the city was
              hiding.

               I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through this with me. Bottom line is
              he was already at his attorney's office and on the phone with the City of Kenai attorney's office working on a strategy.

              The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human resource response when you have any
              allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to sexual harassment, you remove immediately the person from
              the any of supervisory duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this woman) until you can substantiate or
              unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the claim and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.

              Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he can and set the record
              straight. He will have the city Mayor by his side and she will attest to the situation in favor of Chuck. Privileged or Per
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

              That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in the morning with some
              more follow up.

              My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a press conf to
              defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are
              any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.
               He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good Alaskans say that this is
              NOT a good situation he's in.
