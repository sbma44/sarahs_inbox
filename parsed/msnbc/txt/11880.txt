           Things look fine. This will just be low key as the Governor stated. I will be available
           also.  Janice

          Hello,



          Just a quick recap for tonight's event:



          Two screens set-up in the Library & Ballroom; seating for 25 (and extra chairs available).
          Since there's not a firm guest count it helps so it doesn't look sparse, then chairs can
          easily be added as they're needed.



          Dining table set up in Main Hall with beverages & beer (in buckets w. ice), wine, & coffee
          along with appetizers.



          The Dining room- I'll add some chairs so people can use that room to mingle and visit.



          Media:  you won't lose your cable in the mst.bedroom this time. Volume adjustments will
          be next to the projectors- not

          hooked into the House system and you can change the channels.



          Ivy- do you have a guess/estimate on numbers?



         Let me know if you'd like to change anything!
                                                                1




                                                                                                                PRA_GSP01_0011449

           I think 5:00 pm to 6:30ish. The results will be trickling in--we might not learn much in
           terms of results, but it will be fun and low key.

                  Erika- I don't anticipate needing anyone to staff tomorrow's

                  super tuesday event be as long as we've got tvs set up and food

                  available I can keep the table stocked - we don't know how many folks

                  will stop by and I don't want the third floor to make any big deal out

                  of me inviting people to the house... it seems like they interpret it as

                  a big deal if they think. staff will be called in for OT or it'll be a

                  burden on staff... So, I think Ivy and I can handle folks stopping by.

                  Ivy- how many do you think?
