             Dr. Tomera was removed from the medical board effective Wednesday , September 5t'.

             We consulted with Dave Jones about options , and consequently asked for Tomera 's resignation again through his
             attorney. Our request in writing had a deadline of September 4'. We did not hear from Tomera 's Attorney in the
             timeframe given , and sent the removal letter after a day of leeway . While the letter was in transit, Tomera's
             attorney contacted us saying Tomera would resign , however no letter was sent . They eventually received the
             letter of removal and contacted us back that essentially the removal letter was sufficient.

             We are now on a search to fill that seat as well. The ED of the Board says that ideal candidate would be either a
             psychiatrist or an anesthesiologist . We may have a psychiatrist candidate , and will be checking in the
             anesthesiology arena as well.

             Dan has put together an excellent chronology of facts which we'll keep in case it is needed down the road..
