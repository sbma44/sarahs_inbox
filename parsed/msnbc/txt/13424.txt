                This is just to show I submitted this letter to the editor yesterday , and it may not be published, but, I thought you
                might like it. Please give my regards to Sarah Palin, by saying "A baby's entrance into the earth makes it
                renewed in innocence." Said by a great church leader. Please give a copy of this and the last email into the hands
                of Sarah, I know she would appreciate "a little" freshness, despite all the hectic hecticness of all things in the
                political arena. It doesn't hurt to give it into her hands, it's just a little thing. Thx.
