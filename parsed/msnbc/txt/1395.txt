  Todd, here's the email. Thanks for the phone call! Erika

  Former First Ladies Tea
  Saturday, August 2, 2008
  Reception 2:00 to 4:00pm.
  100 Guests

  GUEST LIST
  Mr. Palin's Guest List
  First Ladies & Guest(s)
  Capital City Celebrations Board Members & spouse
  Juneau's Top 50 Volunteers
  If there's still room, we'd re-visit who to invite and submit that list to you for your approval.

  The committee was trying to figure out the best way to invite a diverse group of locals, so they came up
  with the Top 50 idea.
  Juneau's Top 50 Community Volunteers:
  Capital City Celebrations would accept nominations, and then select Juneau's Top 50 Volunteers. The
  Top 50 would be invited to the Tea, and other events throughout the year. Many ideas were discussed,
  but this seemed like an objective way to choose half of the guests for the tea and honor those who
  have     stepped out as volunteers in the community. It's important to include our youth, so an extra effort
  will be made to target service organizations and schools, so that guests would also include a young/teen
  age group.

  INVITATIONS
  Unless you would like to make the phone call, I would call or email the former First Ladies and give them
  advance notice of the tea and see if they would be available.
  Invitations:
  We could send out the invitation from you and the committee; I could send some rough draft ideas for
  your approval. Let me know if you have any format or wording that you'd like for me to follow?

  TRAVEL & LODGING

  The Capital City Celebrations committee could look for donations for airline tickets and hotel
  accommodations. Do you have any thoughts or guidelines for this? If not, I can have them take care of
  the arrangements and run it by you for final approval.

  FUNDRAISING
  The only fundraising that's being considered is having the First Spouse' sign a few prints that could later
  be sold.

  MEDIA COVERAGE
  The committee is looking to have this covered by the media. If that's okay with you then they will proceed
  with contacting KTOO and others.

  PRE-EVENT
  Would you want to have a lunch from about 12:00 to 1:00pm. for only you and the Former 1St Ladies? It
  would be a great opportunity to visit with them and hear their stories.

  We could invite the Capital City Celebrations committee to the lunch as well, or have them come at
  1:30pm. (half an hour before the reception), so they have a chance to meet you and the 1St Ladies, before
  everyone else arrives.

                                                                                                      ROSTON 02509

  Hi Todd,
  I attached this to the email in a word document , might make for easier reading.

  Here's what was proposed and came out of the meeting with Cathie Roemmich and the two Capital City
  Celebrations board members. As the host for this event, you'll have the final say on everything.

  I'm sure you're aware that this is all time sensitive as there's a lot of preliminary planning, most
  importantly contacting the 1St Ladies to check on their availability. Please let me know what is
  acceptable and what changes you'd like to make. We could start from scratch if you had envisioned
  something totally different then what's listed.

  Thanks,
  Erika
