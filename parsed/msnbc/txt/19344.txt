              So is that the green light to get this moving? I'd be happy to make the offer and arrangements while you
              are out of state.

              By the way I have a meeting scheduled with Walt Friday afternoon. I will call you with the results of that
              meeting.

              Mr. N. I am forwarding an email to Denby (which he requested) on my (our) thoughts
              about replacing the Deputy Commissioner for Wildlife at F&G. Although there are a
              huge number of Alaskans who realize that the Governor has not made any progress on
              her "managing for abundance" direction, there is an opportunity here to take small
              steps in that direction. I think the earlier confrontational attitudes are set aside for
              now and most of us would really like to see her and the Department move in the right
              direction.

              Hope the Special Session goes well for the Acting Chief of Staff, I'm headed for
              Gakona to catch a few more sockeye in the fishwheel.

              Commissioner, Thanks for including us (me) in your search for a new DC. You are aware I
              was not a KTaylor fan when you selected him but you did use him to best effect and mostly
              kept him out of the chain of command for Wildlife issues. His replacement can be an
              opportunity to take a few steps for the management of wildlife adding emphasis on actions
              that result in desired changes to the various wildlife populations. Jennifer Yuhas, who
              confided your conversation with her, and a few locals met me for lunch and we discussed
              what we could say to help you.

              In the early Knowles administration, I had several discussions with the then Commissioner
              Rue and Wildlife Director Smith about why it was that we had established "minimum
              conditions" for fish resources (like minimum escapement) but even with the emphasis added
              by the Legislature with the intensive management statute revisions, we couldn't seem to get
              behind the "minimum conditions" (like population objectives set by the Board of Game) for
              wildlife. I suspect commercial fishing interests with the attendant political pressures had a
              lot to do with keeping the feet to the fire for fish. There is no parallel on the wildlife side
              and I certainly can't compare Alaska's professional hunting organizations with the interest or
              clout of commercial fishermen. I and many other Alaskans and the Legislators expected the
              IM changes would result in "emphasis added".

              The lack of enthusiasm in the Department for "managing" to the population objective
              minimums needs some emphasis and we are hoping a new Deputy Commissioner can work
              in that direction as well as continue the Federal coordination interface and the more detailed
              but cumbersome issues like endangered species coordination.

              The coordination functions can best be served by someone who knows the "bottom line" on
              both sides of the issue and can both hold the line for Alaska's interests and recognize how far
              the federal interests can and will go. It is my opinion that some ofyour
              present "representatives" can talk the talk but lack the ability to get tough, when it's needed. I
              would recommend you consider someone with background and backbone in Wildlife issues
              and controversies and avoid someone who just "wants to get along with everyone".

              One issue a new DC can review is the relationship between having some resources serve
              statewide issues as opposed to regional issues. The new sheep biologist position for Region
              II is an example. I don't think Doug or anyone else thinks that position won't serve the
              whole spectrum of dall sheep issues regardless of which region needs assistance. There are
              some "specialties" that would best serve as "statewide" resources and they could be
              coordinated by the new DC regardless of where the office is physically located. I remain an
              advocate of having the Directors and Deputies and Special Assistants located down the hall
              from your office whenever possible.

              It is not my intent to recommend you shake up the internal politics of the Department with
              this appointment, rather, I'd like to see some small steps to add emphasis to the management
              possibilities for the Wildlife Conservation Division.

              I wish we had a perfect name for you on this one, but we don't. I would be happy to discuss
              any "other" names you might have in mind and I wish you luck in finding the right person.
              We remain committed to helping you manage for abundance. The energy crisis points out
              the extreme value in providing resources for Alaskans to eat. I'm sure both Boards will hear
              a lot about that this Fall.

              I'm headed south again Wednesday to see if I can catch a few more Copper River sockeye.
              Good luck.
