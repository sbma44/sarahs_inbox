             Similar experience in Corrections. We heard them out and were unable to commit to jump over the table.

             I had the same experience as Walt, except my stack looks more like 8 inches. I have to
             admit they get a sympathetic ear from Commissioners who hear nothing but recruitment
             and retention complaints from all divisions. I recognize that we're in a negotiation, and I
             gave them no commitment other than hear them out, which I did. I'd like to hear more
             about the proposed AO, though.

             I, for one have been contacted, and left with an approximate 5 inch high stack of paperwork. I do recall
             that this general issue has been discussed between all of us earlier, I also understand that we are
             working for a fair resolution to these negations and had stated so.

             Commissioner Kreitzer is in travel status, but asked that I forward this message to
             all of you. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

             Thank You.

             Commissioners:

             I'm aware that Bruce Ludwig, Business Agent for the APEA-Supervisory Unit, has
             either met with some you or is requesting a meeting with you. I want to remind you
             that labor negotiations are just that - negotiations. We have been negotiating in
             good faith with the union which represents some employees in your department.

             I have my charge from Governor Palin and I understand what the bottom line is. What
             I need you to do, is remember that as Bruce tells you his concerns - you have
             perhaps not heard the issues from my perspective.

             Please contact me directly with any questions you might have as a result of your
             conversations with Bruce.  I have done more to be transparent about labor
             negotiations than, I believe, any other Commissioner, by posting our last best
             offers online.  You can access that information here:

             http:// www.state .ak.us/local/ akpages /ADMIN /LaborContractUpdate.shtml

            We are all in this together. We all need quality, professional State employees.
            Governor Palin has the draft administrative order I referred to in our last Cabinet
            meeting and I expect we'll be moving forward shortly.

            Thanks for your patience.
