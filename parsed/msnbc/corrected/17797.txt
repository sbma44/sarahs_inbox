            Kenai and
        nchorage District C.
                    Governor,
        I'm forwarding a message from Attorney Kevin Clarkson re recommendations on judges
        (Anchorage and Kenai District Courts). You'll remember Kevin was the attorney Loren Leman
        relied on and I spoke with him during our first days in office re same sex benefits case.
